      "A leaderless America slips deep into a grim pandemic winter\n",
      "(CNN)America is sliding into a winter limbo of alarming spikes in Covid-19 cases and deepening economic pain while an apathetic lame duck White House and a deadlocked Congress provide no political leadership.\"We're entering into what really is a precarious situation because we're in the middle of a steep slope,\" Fauci said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"US Surgeon General Jerome Adams pleaded with Americans to stick to mask wearing and social distancing.\"I want to be straight with the American people, it's going to get worse over the next several weeks,\" he said on Fox News Sunday. \"The actions that we take in the next several days will determine how bad it is or whether or not we continue to flatten our curve.\"And another senior member of the White House coronavirus task force, Dr. Deborah Birx, who said she hopes to begin briefing Biden's team this week after a transition delayed by the President, said people who traveled for the holiday should get tested and avoid vulnerable relatives.\"To every American, this is the moment to protect yourself and your family,\" Birx said on CBS's \"Face the Nation.\"Pressure mounts on Congress to avert economic devastationWith the President absent, it will fall to governors and mayors to pick up the mantle of leadership again. But a flurry of new restrictions on public gatherings and restrictions on restaurants is likely to further damage an economy that has been hammered by the pandemic.So pressure is rising on Congress to break out of its partisan stasis and offer more help to millions of Americans who are out of work because of the pandemic.Lawmakers will return to Washington after the holiday this week after months of the two chambers failing to pass a new and combined Covid-19 aid package. The prospects for progress still look grim with a funding deal needed to avert a partial government shutdown by December 11. In the past, however, such deadlines have sometimes spurred a modicum of political cover that allows incremental deals. Still, a more comprehensive pandemic package may have to await the arrival of the new President in January. But the reality of divided power in Washington — pending two runoffs in Georgia that will decide control of the Senate -- and the likelihood that Senate Republicans will rediscover their budget hawk instincts with a Democrat in the White House, only add to Biden's huge problems. There is also concern that the failure of Congress to act will hamper the ability of states to train workers and effectively distribute several vaccine candidates.Biden, who will have further meetings with his transition team this week and is finally due to receive the President's Daily Brief, is pressing ahead with building out his White House team.On Sunday, he named an all-female White House messaging operation, which will include former Obama White House communications director Jen Psaki, a former CNN political commentator, returning to the White House as press secretary and Kate Bedingfield, a top campaign official, as the new West Wing's communications director.The President-elect is also expected to make official the nomination of former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to be the first woman to serve as Treasury secretary. If confirmed, Adewale \"Wally\" Adeyemo -- Biden's pick for deputy Treasury secretary -- would be the first Black person to hold that powerful position.Biden is expected to build out his diverse economic team with Neera Tanden, who would be the first woman of color to lead the Office of Management and Budget. Tanden, the chief executive of the Center for American Progress, is a controversial figure among some progressives after working as a campaign aide to Hillary Clinton in her 2016 battle for the nomination against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Biden is also poised to name Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton economist, to lead the Council of Economic Advisers, elevating another Black woman in a high-profile role in the incoming administration.While Biden was building a new administration, Trump spent the weekend playing golf, and at Camp David while launching fresh, spurious claims about election fraud. He claimed there was \"tremendous cheating\" by Democrats in a Fox Business interview that featured almost no pushback from sympathetic anchor Maria Bartiromo.Providing no evidence for his lies about the \"greatest fraud in the history of our country,\" the President more importantly offered no answers or responsibility for the testing days ahead in the worst domestic crisis to afflict the country since World War II.CNN's Jeff Zeleny contributed to this story.\n",

      "Kim Jong Un is cutting off his economic lifeline, China, to stave off Covid-19\n",
      "(CNN)Kim Jong Un appears to have kicked North Korea's pandemic prevention plan into overdrive, further tightening the country's nearly impassible borders, cutting off nearly all trade with China and even allegedly executing a customs officials for failing to handle imported goods appropriately.Beijing exported just $253,000 worth of goods to Pyongyang in October -- a drop of 99% from September to October, according to data published by China's customs administration. For context, that's less in terms of dollar value than China exported to Liechtenstein and Monaco during October.China is North Korea's biggest trading partner and effectively the Kim regime's economic lifeline -- the country basically doesn't import significantly from anywhere else. Before major UN sanctions were put in place as punishment for North Korea's nuclear weapons program in 2016 and 2017, Beijing accounted for more than 90% of Pyongyang's foreign trade.The new customs figures, if accurate, show that Kim appears to be willing to pare back -- or even cut off -- trade with China to prevent the virus from entering North Korea, even if it means risking the country's food and fuel supply. The move is even more extreme considering mainland China is only reporting a handful of cases each day.North Korea has not publicly acknowledged the drop in trade, or the reason behind it, but the pandemic is the most likely explanation. Kim reportedly had two people executed for Covid-19 related crimes, including a customs official who did not follow virus prevention rules while importing goods from China, a South Korean lawmaker said after being briefed by the country's spy agency.CNN has not been able to independently confirm news of the execution, nor have North Korean officials publicly confirmed it. But if true, the killing is another sign of just how seriously Kim is taking Covid-19.North Korean state media reported Sunday that authorities were enacting new, stricter anti-epidemic measures across the country, including increasing the number of guard posts at border crossings and tightening the rules of sea entry in coastal areas. Authorities have even been ordered to \"incinerate seaborne rubbish.\"Pyongyang's decision to scale back imports from China has affected trade in the other direction. The October customs data, from Beijing, showed that Chinese imports from North Korea are down 74% year-on-year. That's forced industries in China, such as hair and wig manufacturers, to search elsewhere for cheap labor.Chinese hair factories often outsourced intensive manual labor to North Korea, sending in raw materials and paying North Korean companies to have their workers finish the products. But since the North Korea-China border closed in January to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the trade flow dried up and prices soared.Why North Korea can't afford an outbreakNorth Korea was one of the first countries in the world to shut its borders when news of Covid-19 emerged from Wuhan, China. Almost all travel into the country ceased shortly after, and this summer the city of Kaesong was placed under lockdown after reports that a defector may have brought the virus in. North Korean state media regularly carries pieces reminding its people on the importance of its emergency anti-epidemic campaign.Experts believe Pyongyang's vigilant response is in place because Kim's regime recognizes just how much trouble it would have containing a pandemic that has overwhelmed some of the world's best health care systems.North Korea's crumbling health care infrastructure is unlikely to be up to the task of treating a large number of patients sickened with a virus that the global health care community still does not fully understand. North Korea already has trouble treating other infectious diseases such as tuberculosis.Defectors who have fled the country and aide workers who have volunteered there say North Korean hospitals and medical facilities are often dilapidated and lack proper equipment and medicine. People who fled during the famine of the 1990s shared stories of amputations done without anesthesia or doctors selling medicine to buy food to survive.Pyongyang has not publicly admitted to a single case of Covid-19 within its borders, but many question that an infectious disease that has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide and infected 62.6 million did not make it inside North Korea.Evans Revere, a former US assistant secretary of state for East Asia and the Pacific, believes the latest steps taken by the Kim regime \"suggest that an already serious situation -- the pandemic -- has gotten a lot worse.\"Revere said the situation in North Korea is looking particularly dire because of a combination of factors that the pandemic is exacerbating: severe weather, potential crop shortages, the impact of international sanctions, and cutting off trade with China. These are major challenges that Kim must deal with as his country prepares for an important meeting of the ruling Workers' Party in January, where a new five-year plan is expected to be announced.\"The fact that we're getting so many reports suggesting that there's been a massive lockdown and crackdown and possible executions, tells me that something significant is up. And it's it doesn't bode well for not only North Korea's economy, but for the ability of many people to get by on a day-to-day basis in North Korea,\" Revere said.\"This is a pretty serious situation for the North Korean leader, and this also may explain the relative quiet that we've seen from North Korea since the US presidential election. They may very well be inward looking right now and trying to figure out how to get through the next few months.\"North Korea has yet to comment on President-elect Joe Biden's victory in the US elections. Biden will likely approach negotiations with Pyongyang much differently than President Donald Trump, who established a personal relationship with Kim in the hopes that it could lead to a diplomatic breakthrough.CNN's Yoonjung Seo, Gawon Bae and Rebecca Wright contributed to this report\n",

      "In Japan, more people died from suicide last month than from Covid in all of 2020. And women have been impacted most\n",
      "Tokyo (CNN)Eriko Kobayashi has tried to kill herself four times.The first time, she was just 22 years old with a full-time job in publishing that didn't pay enough to cover her rent and grocery bills in Tokyo. \"I was really poor,\" said Kobayashi, who spent three days unconscious in hospital after the incident.Now 43, Kobayashi has written books on her mental health struggles and has a steady job at an NGO. But the coronavirus is bringing back the stress she used to feel.\"My salary was cut, and I cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel,\" she said. \"I constantly feel a sense of crisis that I might fall back into poverty.\"Experts have warned that the pandemic could lead to a mental health crisis. Mass unemployment, social isolation, and anxiety are taking their toll on people globally.In Japan, government statistics show suicide claimed more lives in October than Covid-19 has over the entire year to date. The monthly number of Japanese suicides rose to 2,153 in October, according to Japan's National Police Agency. As of Friday, Japan's total Covid-19 toll was 2,087, the health ministry said.Japan is one of the few major economies to disclose timely suicide data -- the most recent national data for the US, for example, is from 2018. The Japanese data could give other countries insights into the impact of pandemic measures on mental health, and which groups are the most vulnerable.\"We didn't even have a lockdown, and the impact of Covid is very minimal compared to other countries ... but still we see this big increase in the number of suicides,\" said Michiko Ueda, an associate professor at Waseda University in Tokyo, and an expert on suicides.\"That suggests other countries might see a similar or even bigger increase in the number of suicides in the future.\"Covid's toll on womenJapan has long struggled with one of the highest suicide rates in the world, according to the World Health Organization. In 2016, Japan had a suicide mortality rate of 18.5 per 100,000 people, second only to South Korea in the Western Pacific region and almost double the annual global average of 10.6 per 100,000 people.While the reasons for Japan's high suicide rate are complex, long working hours, school pressure, social isolation and a cultural stigma around mental health issues have all been cited as contributing factors.But for the 10 years leading up to 2019, the number of suicides had been decreasing in Japan, falling to about 20,000 last year, according to the health ministry -- the lowest number since the country's health authorities started keeping records in 1978.The pandemic appears to have reversed that trend, and the rise in suicides has disproportionately affected women. Although they represent a smaller proportion of total suicides than men, the number of women taking their own lives is increasing. In October, suicides among women in Japan increased almost 83% compared to the same month the previous year. For comparison, male suicides rose almost 22% over the same time period.There are several potential reasons for this. Women make up a larger percentage of part-time workers in the hotel, food service and retail industries -- where layoffs have been deep. Kobayashi said many of her friends have been laid off. \"Japan has been ignoring women,\" she said. \"This is a society where the weakest people are cut off first when something bad happens.\"In a global study of more than 10,000 people, conducted by non-profit international aid organization CARE, 27% of women reported increased challenges with mental health during the pandemic, compared to 10% of men.Compounding those worries about income, women have been dealing with skyrocketing unpaid care burdens, according to the study. For those who keep their jobs, when children are sent home from school or childcare centers, it often falls to mothers to take on those responsibilities, as well as their normal work duties.Increased anxiety about the health and well-being of children has also put an extra burden on mothers during the pandemic.Akari, a 35-year-old who did not want to use her real name, said she sought professional help this year when her premature son was hospitalized for six weeks. \"I was pretty much worried 24 hours,\" Akari said. \"I didn't have any mental illness history before, but I could see myself really, really anxious all the time.\"Her feelings got worse as the pandemic intensified, and she worried her son would get Covid-19.\"I felt there was no hope, I felt like I always thought about the worst-case scenario,\" she said.\"A Place for You\"In March, Koki Ozora, a 21-year-old university student, started a 24-hour mental health hotline called Anata no Ibasho (A Place for You). He said the hotline, a nonprofit funded by private donations, receives an average of over 200 calls a day, and that the vast majority of callers are women.\"They lost their jobs, and they need to raise their kids, but they didn't have any money,\" Ozora said. \"So, they attempted suicide.\"Most of the calls come through the night -- from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The nonprofit's 600 volunteers live around the world in different timezones and are awake to answer them. But there aren't enough volunteers to keep up with the volume of messages, Ozora said.They prioritize the texts that are most urgent -- looking for keywords such as suicide or sexual abuse. He said they respond to 60% of texts within five minutes, and volunteers spend an average of 40 minutes with each person.Anonymously, over online messaging, people share their deepest struggles. Unlike most mental health hotlines in Japan, which take requests over the phone, Ozora says many people -- especially the younger generation -- are more comfortable asking for help via text.In April, he said the most common messages were from mothers who were feeling stressed about raising their kids, with some confessing to thoughts of killing their own children. These days, he says messages from women about job losses and financial difficulties are common -- as well as domestic violence.\"I've been accepting messages, like 'I'm being raped by my father' or 'My husband tried to kill me,'\" Ozora said. \"Women send these kinds of texts almost every day. And it's increasing.\" He added that the spike in messages is because of the pandemic. Before, there were more places to \"escape,\" like schools, offices or friend's homes.Pressure on childrenJapan is the only G-7 country where suicide is the leading manner of death for young people aged 15 to 39. And suicides among those under 20 had been increasing even before the pandemic, according to health ministry.As pandemic restrictions take children out of school and social situations, they're dealing with abuse, stressful home lives, and pressures from falling behind on homework, Ozora said. Some children as young as five years old had messaged the hotline, he added.School closures during the pandemic in the spring have contributed to homework piling up; kids also have less freedom to see friends, which is also contributing to stress, according to Naho Morisaki, of the National Center for Child Health and Development. The center recently conducted an internet survey of more than 8,700 parents and children and found that 75% of Japanese schoolchildren showed signs of stress due to the pandemic.Morisaki says he thinks there's a big correlation between the anxiety of children and their parents. \"The children who are self-injuring themselves have the stress, and then they can't speak out to their family because probably they see that their moms or dads are not able to listen to them.\"Stigma of solving the problemIn Japan, there is still a stigma against admitting loneliness and struggle. Ozora said it's common for women and parents to start the conversation with his service with the phrase: \"I know it's bad to ask for help, but can I talk?\"Ueda says the \"shame\" of talking about depression often holds people back.\"It's not something that you talk about in public, you don't talk about it with friends or anything,\" she said. \"(It) could lead to a delay in seeking help, so that's one potential cultural factor that we have in here.\"Akari, the mother of the premature baby, agrees. She had previously lived in the US, where she says it seems easier to seek help. \"When I lived in America, I knew people who went through therapy, and it's a more common thing to do, but in Japan it's very difficult,\" she said.Following the financial crisis in the 1990s, Japan's suicide rate surged to a record high in 2003, when roughly 34,000 people took their own lives. Experts say the shame and anxiety from layoffs, of mostly men at the time, contributed to depression and increased suicide rates. In the early 2000s, the Japanese government accelerated investment and efforts around suicide prevention and survivor support, including passing the Basic Act for Suicide Prevention in 2006 to provide support to those affected by the issue.But both Ozora and Kobayashi say it has not been nearly enough: reducing the suicide rate requires Japanese society to change.\"It's shameful for others to know your weakness, so you hide everything, hold it in yourself, and endure,\" Kobayashi said. \"We need to create the culture where it's OK to show your weakness and misery.\"Celebrity suicidesA succession of Japanese celebrities have taken their lives in recent months. While the Japanese media rarely details the specifics of such deaths -- deliberately not dwelling on method or motive -- the mere reporting on these cases often causes an increase in suicide in the general public, according to experts such as Ueda.Hana Kimura, a 22-year-old professional wrestler and star of the reality show \"Terrace House,\" died by suicide over the summer, after social media users bombarded her with hateful messages. Hana's mother, Kyoko Kimura, says she was conscious that media reports on her daughter's death may have affected others who were feeling suicidal.\"When Hana died, I asked the police repeatedly not to disclose any concrete situation of her death, but still, I see the reporting of information only the police knew,\" Kimura said. \"It's a chain reaction of grief.\"Kimura said the pandemic led her daughter to spend more time reading toxic social media messages, as she was unable to wrestle because of coronavirus restrictions. Kimura is now setting up an NGO called \"Remember Hana\" to raise awareness about cyberbullying.\"She found her reason to live by fighting as a professional wrestler. It was a big part of her. She was in a really tough situation as she could not wrestle,\" Kimura said. \"The coronavirus pandemic made society more suffocating.\"The third waveIn recent weeks, Japan has reported record-high daily Covid-19 cases, as doctors warn of a third wave that could intensify in the winter months. Experts worry that the high suicide rate will get worse as the economic fallout continues.\"We haven't even experienced the full economic consequences of the pandemic,\" Ueda said. \"The pandemic itself can get worse, then maybe there's a semi-lockdown again; if that happens, then the impact can be huge.\"Compared with some other nations, Japan's coronavirus restrictions have been relatively relaxed. The country declared a state of emergency but has never imposed a strict lockdown, for example, and its quarantine restrictions for international arrivals have not been as unbending as those in China.But as cases rise, some worry harsher restrictions will be needed -- and are concerned about how that could affect mental health.\"We didn't even have a lockdown, and the impact of Covid is very minimal compared to other countries ... but still we see this big increase in the number of suicides,\" Ueda said. \"That suggests other countries might see a similar or even bigger increase in the number of suicides in the future.\"Despite having to deal with a salary cut and constant financial insecurity, Kobayashi says she is now much better at managing her anxiety. She hopes that by speaking publicly about her fears, more people will do the same and realize they are not alone, before it's too late.\"I come out to the public and say that I have been mentally ill and suffered from depression in the hope that others might be encouraged to speak out,\" Kobayashi said. \"I am 43 now and life starts to get more fun in the middle of my life. So, I feel it's good that I am still alive.\"How to get help: In the US, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255. The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated Japan's suicide mortality rate compared to the global average. It is almost double the annual global average of 10.6 per 100,000 people.\n",

      "Here's what happened over Thanksgiving weekend\n",
      "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.(CNN)President Donald Trump said for the first time on Thanksgiving that he will leave office if the Electoral College votes for President-elect Joe Biden.\"Certainly I will, and you know that,\" he said when asked by a reporter about leaving the White House if Biden is declared the winner on December 14. \"I will and, you know that.\"Republicans also lost another election case. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit Saturday night from US Rep. Mike Kelly and other Republicans, who had tried to invalidate absentee voting and block the certification of votes in recent weeks.The dismissal adds to a growing number of losses in court for Republicans and supporters of Trump. The lawsuits have failed almost uniformly.A new push is underway at the White House. With the election reality setting in, Republicans and aides to Trump are encouraging him to at least consider attending Biden's swearing-in.Biden is rapidly building out his Cabinet. All of the Cabinet positions will require Senate confirmation, but here's who he's selected so far.SCOTUS to hear Census case tomorrow. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments concerning the Trump administration's effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from being counted when congressional seats are re-allocated among the 50 states next year.Still no progress on stimulus. GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told CNN's Dana Bash that the lack of a new coronavirus relief bill amounts to a \"huge failure.\"The pressure will be on when lawmakers return to Washington this week -- but they also have to move quickly to pass a spending package to avert a partial government shutdown by December 11, which could once again distract from the need for Covid-19 relief.Georgia, on everyone's mindThe fate of the Senate majority lies in Georgia, where a pair of January 5 runoff elections will determine which political party controls the United States Senate.If either of the incumbent Republicans, Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, hold onto their seats, the party will maintain its majority control in the chamber.If Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Rev. Raphael Warnock both prevail, however, Democrats would gain control of the Senate thanks to Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' tie-breaking vote.Trump is getting in the fight. He said Thursday he will travel to the state to support the Republican candidates. \"Speaking of Georgia, I'll be going there,\" the President told reporters after his Thanksgiving video teleconference call with US service members.\"Maybe I'll go twice,\" Trump said at one point, noting that he'd love to do it in a stadium, \"But you can't, because of Covid.\"Ossoff says government 'paralysis' is at stake. The Democrat warned this morning that if Republicans hold onto the chamber next year, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would cause \"paralysis\" at a time of crisis when the government needs to act to help struggling Americans combat the economic impact of the coronavirus.RNC focuses on voter-turnout. At a Saturday campaign stop in Marietta, Georgia, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel attempted to persuade Republicans to vote in the Georgia Senate runoff elections, even as voters expressed ambivalence about expanding \"money and work when it's already decided.\"'A very dangerous place'The warnings pouring in from health experts could not be more urgent.The US is \"rounding the corner into a calamity,\" Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency medicine physician, told CNN.\"This is like a natural disaster occurring in all 50 states at the same time,\" said Dr. Megan Ranney, a CNN medical analyst.\"We have to understand we're in a very dangerous place. People have to stop swapping air,\" said Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.A record-breaking 91,635 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized on Saturday, according to the Covid Tracking Project. And a surge of new infections could overwhelm hospitals already stretched to capacity.If you traveled for Thanksgiving, get tested. That's the message from Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir, who told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of The Union\" this morning it's vital that Americans do \"the common sense things\" in the weeks ahead.\"Make really sure you adhere 100% to mask wearing to avoid crowds because you could inadvertently have gotten Covid and spread it, so just be careful during the week after your travel because you are at increased risk,\" he said.\"Just remember you've had an increased risk of being exposed, so you should decrease unnecessary activities for about a week, and if you can get tested in three or five days that's also a very good idea.\"Vaccines are being distributed. The Federal Aviation Administration says it has supported \"the first mass air shipment\" of a Covid-19 vaccine. But remember, no vaccine has been approved yet.Pfizer has applied to the FDA for emergency use authorization for its vaccine and biotech company Moderna is expected to do so soon.Trump claimed coronavirus would disappear after the election. It obviously hasn't. In fact, a new Monmouth University poll finds that 27% of Americans say that the pandemic is the biggest issue facing Biden over the next four years.As CNN's Harry Enten notes: The ongoing pandemic means that Biden will have a tough job ahead of him as he begins his presidency in less than two months. Biden's difficult task isn't just about the coronavirus cases, but about everything that is connected to it, including the economy and the mental health of Americans.QAnon is making the pandemic worse for at-risk kidsAs we've talked about in this newsletter before, child welfare organizations have felt the full weight of the pandemic as they navigate concerns about unreported abuse and work to ensure their resources are available.But now, deeper into the outbreak, a new challenge is emerging that's complicating their critical outreach efforts: the QAnon conspiracy theory.Remember: The most basic QAnon belief -- entirely divorced from reality -- casts Trump as the hero in a fight against the \"deep state\" and a sinister cabal of Democratic politicians and celebrities who abuse children. It features an anonymous government insider called \"Q\" who purportedly shares secret information about that fight via cryptic online posts.And it's the behavior of those who follow the conspiracy theory -- their supposed efforts to help abused children -- that's putting an increasing strain on the resources of actual child welfare groups.The problem has become so severe that one such organization, Childhelp, says it had to set up an auto-response message on its crisis hotline to filter out QAnon callers after their name appeared in a QAnon meme.\"If you have a hotline counselor who is taking time to speak to someone discussing a debunked conspiracy theory, there may be a child holding on the next line,\" Daphne Young, chief communications officer for Childhelp, told CNN.\n",

      "CDC Covid-19 vaccine advisers call emergency meeting to vote on who gets one first\n",
      "(CNN)Advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have called an emergency meeting for Tuesday to vote on who they recommend should be the first to get a coronavirus vaccine once one is authorized.The CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices wants to have advice out to the public ahead of any decision from the US Food and Drug Administration about emergency authorization of a vaccine, ACIP chair Dr. Jose Romero told CNN.\"We are meeting because the FDA, the Operation Warp Speed, have asked states and other jurisdictions to please submit their plans on Friday of this coming week,\" Romero said.\"We foresee imminent authorization if this vaccine is shown to be effective and safe in the near future and we want to be at the point where we are providing appropriate guidance to the states and jurisdictions for the use of these vaccines,\" said Romero, who is Secretary for Health for the Arkansas Department of Health.\"This is not something that is being rushed. We have already discussed the groups within the first tier. We are simply going over the data once again and having a vote primarily on the first tier group 1a -- healthcare providers and the people in the long term, congregate facilities.\"ACIP met last Monday to discuss the priority groups for receiving any vaccine that may get emergency use authorization from the FDA. The CDC has already recommended that the first group -- designated as 1a -- should include frontline health providers and support personnel.\"It is important because these are the individuals that are really at the front line providing the care,\" Romero said.The 1a group likely should also include residents of nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, who have been badly hit by the pandemic, the CDC has said. \"Long term care facility residents and staff accounted for 6% of cases and 39% of deaths in the US, despite the fact that long term care facility residents account for less than 1% of the US population,\" the CDC's Dr. Kathleen Dooling told ACIP on Monday.Vaccinating them could make a big difference, Romero said.There are not going to be enough vaccines for everyone at first, so choices have to be made.The CDC estimates there are 21 million healthcare personnel, 87 million essential workers, 100 million adults with high-risk medical conditions and 53 million others 65 and older. The federal government has said 40 million coronavirus vaccine doses could be available by the end of December.Dr. Larry Corey of the University of Washington, who is heading up coronavirus vaccine clinical trials in the US, has said if both Pfizer and Moderna get vaccines authorized, they could supply 50 million more doses in January and 60 million more in February and March.Other vaccines are in the works, as well.Those vaccines require two doses taken three to four weeks apart to be effective, so that would mean roughly enough vaccines to cover 75 million people by the end of March.ACIP's priorities will help decide who gets access to those scarce vaccines first.\"The plan is to roll out doses of vaccines over the next few weeks to months in order to cover the 1a, 1b and 1c groups. There are not going to be sufficient vaccines for everybody in the first allotment,\" Romero said.\"It is important for the public to understand that we are dealing with select groups of individuals -- not the general public.\"Pfizer has applied to the FDA for EUA for its vaccine and biotech company Moderna is expected to do so soon. The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its own vaccine advisers for December 10. Sources have told CNN another meeting is being scheduled for December 17.Romero said it was important for people to know ACIP will hold a public meeting and a public vote. All ACIP meetings are public and livestreamed.Members of the committee will also discuss clinical considerations. One worry is side effects from the vaccine, and whether vaccinating frail nursing home residents, who may be likely to suffer a number of health events regardless of vaccination, could damage faith in the safety of the immunizations.\"I think we can deal with it,\" Romero said.The advisers will also discuss how to monitor safety after allocation of the vaccine, according to the meeting document.The entire process is on a faster-than-usual timeline. The vaccine makers sped development and manufacture of the vaccines and have been making them at the same time they have been tested -- something not usually done.While the safety and efficacy testing itself isn't being cut short, the FDA is considering the Pfizer vaccine and will likely consider any others under emergency use authorization rather than full approval -- a quicker process because of the pandemic. The vaccines will also have to undergo full approval later.And while ACIP usually only meets three times a year to consider the vaccine schedule, the committee has added meetings to consider the coronavirus vaccines.\n",

      "'A natural disaster ... in all 50 states' is unfolding just as travelers disperse nationwide after Thanksgiving\n",
      "(CNN)As millions of Americans head home after Thanksgiving, the coronavirus could be hitching a ride -- threatening to plant seeds of infection across the country as the US on Sunday topped more than 100,000 new cases for the 27th consecutive day.So far Sunday, the United States has reported 109,671 new cases and 731 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.A surge of new travel-related infections could overwhelm hospitals already stretched to capacity. Hospitalizations of Covid-19 patients reached a record high of 93,238 on Sunday, trumping Saturday's record-breaking 91,635 figure, according to the Covid Tracking Project.It is the third time there have been over 90,000 Americans hospitalized with Covid-19 -- the first being Thursday with 90,481 before a drop to 89,834 Friday that could be attributed to inconsistencies in reporting over Thanksgiving.\"There's no way that the hospitals can be fully prepared for what we're currently facing,\" emergency medicine physician Dr. Megan Ranney said.\"This is like a natural disaster occurring in all 50 states at the same time. There are not adequate beds. There are not adequate staff. And because of the lack of national preparation, there are still not adequate supplies,\" said Ranney, a CNN medical analyst and director of the Brown-Lifespan Center for Digital Health at Brown University.\"Here in Rhode Island, we are currently planning to open our field hospital on Tuesday because our hospitals are so full of sick Covid-19 patients. But not every state has that option,\" she said.\"And even if you open a field hospital, if you have hundreds of staff who are sick -- which is what many states across the country are currently facing -- if you don't have nurses and doctors and respiratory techs, even a field hospital isn't going to save you. Our health care system is literally at the breaking point right now, thanks to Covid-19.\"New cases now mean new hospitalizations by ChristmasSunday is expected to be the busiest air travel day of the entire pandemic even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Americans not travel for Thanksgiving.Roughly 6 million travelers passed through security at US airports after the CDC's travel warning in the week leading up to Thanksgiving.But it will be weeks before anyone knows how much of a role Thanksgiving gatherings and travel play in new hospitalizations and deaths.\"When you look at people who are hospitalized today, they were infected two weeks ago, maybe more,\" said Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University. \"And then it takes usually another week for folks to succumb to the illness.\"So infections picked up on Thanksgiving \"are going to show up in three weeks and are going to show up in deaths over Christmas and New Year's and are going to spread in every state,\" Ranney said.Statistics reported in the days after the holiday might show a relative dip in Covid-19 cases, followed by a surge due to a lag in government agencies' reporting over the long weekend.And given coronavirus' lengthy incubation time and how long it takes an infected person to test positive, cases related to Thanksgiving are unlikely to show in public data until the first full week of December at the earliest.Even before then, Covid-19 is killing Americans at a staggering rate. At least 1,189 new deaths were reported on Saturday alone, according to Johns Hopkins University.More than 266,000 people in the US have died from Covid-19 since the pandemic began.Birx: 'If you're young and you gathered,' get testedHealth experts say anyone who gathered with people outside their household should take serious precautions in the coming days, especially young people who might be carrying and spreading coronavirus without any symptoms.\"If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later,\" said Dr. Deborah Birx on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday. \"You need to assume that you're infected and not go near your grandparents and aunts and others without a mask.\"Birx, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, recommended those over age 65 get tested immediately if they develop any symptoms.\"If you're over 65 or you have comorbidities and you gathered at Thanksgiving -- if you develop any symptoms, you need to be tested immediately,\" she said.ER doctor wants people to follow stay-at-home ordersMany hospitals are on the brink of exceeding capacity, threatening reduced care for everyone -- even those without coronavirus. So officials around the country have reinstated or rolled back on restrictions. In Los Angeles County, a three-week stay-at-home order goes into effect on Monday.\"What I wish is that people would follow those stay-at-home orders,\" said Ranney, the emergency medicine physician in Rhode Island.\"I can't tell you how many patients I take care of who tell me, 'Well, I just went to an indoor restaurant.' Or, 'I just went to a party with a few friends. I didn't actually think I was going to catch Covid.' So those stay-at-home orders are critical.\"The Los Angeles County stay-at-home order prohibits all public and private gatherings with people outside a single household.\"Residents are advised to stay home as much as possible and always wear a face covering over their nose and mouth when they are outside their household and around others,\" the county's public health department said.The order is in effect through December 20. It does not apply to \"faith based services and protests, which are constitutionally protected rights,\" the health department said.Essential retail businesses will be limited to 35% occupancy, while the occupancy limit for nonessential retail operations, personal care services and libraries will be 20%, the county said.\"Even if you're not feeling sick, the simple act of gathering with people outside your household puts everyone at risk,\" county health director Barbara Ferrer said.Ranney said it's possible some schools and workplaces can operate safely if precautions are met.\"I think it's really important that you keep safe workplaces and safe schools open,\" she said. \"We know that in those structured settings, where people are masked, keeping a distance, having adequate ventilation, the spread of the virus is pretty low in those settings,\" she said.\"I am hopeful that that type of order will be effective. And we've seen in France that it works,\" Ranney said. \"I sure hope it will be (effective) in L.A., and I hope the rest of the country can follow suit. Because we need to do something, or -- again -- this virus is just going to just continue to grow out of control.\"California set a new pandemic record on Sunday with 7,415 Covid patients in its hospitals, according to data provided by the California Department of Health.That eclipses the previous California hospitalization record of 7,170 people on July 21.CNN's Melissa Alonso, Leanna Faulk, Chuck Johnston and Alta Spells contributed to this report.\n",

      "Top health officials agree Americans who traveled for Thanksgiving should get tested. But this is where they differ\n",
      "(CNN)Top health officials on Sunday called on Americans to get tested for coronavirus after Thanksgiving travel as an important measure to help mitigate the virus' spread amid a surge in US cases.But when it came to whether individuals should quarantine or isolate, and for how long, responses from the nation's leading experts differed.Assistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that it is \"not recommended to have a quarantine after travel unless you've had a direct exposure to a person with Covid for 15 minutes in close contact.\"But Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, went a step further, encouraging individuals returning from travel to quarantine, if possible, to mitigate the spread.\"Right now, as people go back we want to urge them, if they've been in situations outside of the family setting in which they really don't know the level of exposure, to be really careful when you either return from the place that you went or other people come back into your house,\" Fauci told Martha Raddatz on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"That you really gotta understand the importance of trying to prevent further spread and further surge. That may be, when you go back to where you've came from, if it's possible to quarantine yourself for a period of time or even get tested to make sure that you are not bringing infection back to another place, be it another home or another family.\"And US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said those who gathered for Thanksgiving can still isolate and get tested.\"For those who did travel and those who did attend large gatherings, we want you to know it's not too late to take measures to slow the spread of this virus,\" Adams said during an interview on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"You can still isolate, you can still get tested in three to five days, you can still take measures that have been proven to help us prevent cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\"White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx agreed that families who gathered for Thanksgiving should get tested for the virus, and people over age 65 should get tested immediately if they develop any symptoms.\"If you're young and you gathered, you need to be tested about five to 10 days later,\" Birx told Margaret Brennan Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \"You need to assume that you're infected and not go near your grandparents and aunts and others without a mask.\"CDC recommendationsThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that a person quarantine after being in close contact, or \"6 feet of someone who has COVID-19 for a total of 15 minutes or more.\" The CDC also recommends Americans take precautions such as mask wearing inside the home, hand washing, and social distancing \"regardless of where you traveled or what you did during your trip\" to protect others from getting the virus. The agency also advises Americans to follow guidelines in states that require travelers to quarantine or get tested.Giroir on Sunday said Americans who traveled during the Thanksgiving holiday are at an increased risk of contracting the virus, meaning they should get tested, wear masks and avoid big groups.\"Make really sure you adhere 100% to mask wearing to avoid crowds because you could inadvertently have gotten Covid and spread it, so just be careful during the week after your travel because you are at increased risk,\" Giroir told Bash. \"Just remember you've had an increased risk of being exposed, so you should decrease unnecessary activities for about a week, and if you can get tested in three or five days that's also a very good idea.\"The guidance following Thanksgiving comes after health experts warned Americans about traveling to see family and to avoid large gatherings during the holidays as the number of coronavirus cases surges across the US. More than 91,000 Americans were hospitalized with the virus on Saturday, the highest daily number yet in hospitalizations due to the virus.On Wednesday, 1,070,967 people passed through security at US airports nationwide, the highest level since mid-March, Transportation Security Administration spokeswoman Lisa Farbstein said Thursday.'We are at a risky time'Giroir said Sunday he is concerned about a possible surge in cases and hospitalizations as holiday travel increases.\"There certainly can be a surge because of the travel and the mixing of people who have not been in their own little pods,\" he said. \"We are at a risky time because of the travel and again, it's not just the travel, but it's exposing people who have not been sort of in their own pods.\"On a separate program, Fauci said Sunday that he was also concerned about hospitalizations. He said people not adhering to earlier guidance from the CDC and other health experts about avoiding Thanksgiving gatherings could lead to another surge in cases.\"But, you know people are not always going to do that so what we expect unfortunately, as we go to the next couple of weeks into December, that we might see a surge superimposed upon that surge that we're already in,\" Fauci said during an interview on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\"He also said \"it is not too late at all for us to do something about this\" and for Americans to \"be careful\" when traveling back home.Trump painted a far rosier picture of the virus in the US in his first television interview since the election.\"We're doing better than the rest of the world,\" Trump told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo on Sunday, despite the high number of infections the US is experiencing.CNN's Leanna Faulk contributed to this report.\n",

      "What the death of Iran's top nuclear scientist could mean for Biden\n",
      "David A. Andelman (@DavidAndelman), a contributor to CNN, twice winner of the Deadline Club Award and executive director of The Red Lines Project, is the author of the forthcoming \"A Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen\" and host of its Evergreen podcast. He formerly was a correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Europe and Asia. The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion at CNN.(CNN)The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's leading nuclear weapons scientist, could set off a tinder box of violence between Iran, Israel and the United States -- and put the incoming Biden administration in a tight spot when it comes to resetting relations with Tehran.In the wake of Fakhrizadeh's death Friday, Iran's foreign minister, in a tweet, called the death \"cowardice -- with serious indications of Israeli role,\" while the Iranian Armed Forces chief of staff warned of \"severe revenge\" against the scientist's killers.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had no immediate comment, though it's likely he, along with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, discussed how to work against Iran in a meeting in Neom, Saudi Arabia, last Sunday, where Mossad head Yossi Cohen was also present. (One of Netanyahu's confidants, Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi, said Saturday he had \"no clue\" who was behind the killing.)According to Amos Yadlin, the executive director of Israel's Institute for National Security Studies, it's likely the three sides were planning what moves to make before a Biden administration takes office and reengages with Iran. (Saudi Arabia's foreign minister denied the meeting took place). It's also worth mentioning that Fakhrizadeh's assassination follows the pattern of other Mossad attacks on senior officials in the Iranian nuclear program.Saturday, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani blamed Israel for the killing, but promised a response only at \"the right time.\" Still, the circumstances of the attack -- Fakhrizadeh's car was ambushed in daylight just east of the capital -- had to be horrifying and deeply embarrassing to Iran. The nation's inability to protect itself from a strike in its heartland would seem to make it that much more difficult for moderates in Iran to exercise restraint as the country gears up for presidential election in June 2021.It remains unclear whether the United States had any prior knowledge of the attack. Early this month, President Donald Trump asked senior advisers to explore the possibilities for an offensive strike against Iran's main nuclear site, according to The New York Times, after the International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report that said Iran's stockpile of uranium was 12 times the limit set under the Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump withdrew in 2018. At that meeting, Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo, along with other aides, warned that such action could lead to a much broader conflict with potentially horrific consequences for the United States.Following the attack on Fakhrizadeh, Trump retweeted an Israeli journalist, who wrote, \"(Fakhrizadeh) was head of Iran's secret military program and wanted for many years by Mossad. His death is a major psychological and professional blow for Iran.\"The timing of Fakhrizadeh's death is notable. The United States is entering a potentially dangerous period as the anniversary nears of the death of Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, in a US drone strike in Iraq, January 3. Iran's Revolutionary Guard officers, along with many Iranians who revered the leader, believed Tehran's response -- a single missile strike on two US military facilities with enough warning to avoid any casualties -- was weak.Now, the assassination of Fakhrizadeh, who, like Soleimani, was a member of the Revolutionary Guard, only throws more fuel on a fire that Netanyahu, for one, seems to have little interest in extinguishing. After all, there was no apparent indication Fakhrizadeh was planning an immediate operation that could have threatened either Israel or America.The attack -- which may have been timed to take place in the final weeks of Trump's presidency -- could spell trouble for the Biden administration. The President-elect is eager to re-enter the Iran nuclear agreement, and a violent Iranian reprisal might scupper the chance at renewed negotiations before Biden even enters office.Iran will have to weigh competing priorities as it looks ahead. The radical Revolutionary Guard, still smarting over the assassination of Soleimani, will likely call for swift action. But there are also moderates who may be open to cooperating with the incoming Biden administration in a desperate bid to remove the bootheel of sanctions from the nation's economy as it struggles with the Covid-19 pandemic.The key unanswered question is whether Iran will be able to restrain its reflexive impulses to retaliate for Fakhrizadeh's death. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was seen weeping at Soleimani's funeral, is believed to have close ties to the Revolutionary Guard, which has been instrumental in keeping him in power for more than 30 years. He has already called for revenge and vowed to continue the country's \"scientific\" activities in a veiled reference to the country's nuclear activities.But Iranian leaders may also heed moderate forces in the interest of encouraging Biden's hope of returning to the nuclear agreement and relief from sanctions.Will Iran direct its wrath against the United States or focus on retaliating against Israel in response to Fakhrizadeh's killing? And then, the broader question: If Iran does retaliate against Israel, will it respond in kind?At least Saturday's comments from Rouhani raise the hope that there may actually be some adults in the room. They may well be capable of exercising the kind of restraint that could allow the incoming Biden administration to move toward a restoration of the nuclear agreement and a control over any Iranian inclination to rush full-tilt toward a bomb.Above all, it is imperative for Trump to exercise restraint rather than escalate what is already a tense situation. Biden has already signaled on numerous occasions that he will abide by the tradition that there is only one president in charge at a time. But if Trump decides to dive headfirst into this dangerous conflict, Biden and his new national security team will have to be prepared to face a world of hurt when they step into the White House this January.\n",
