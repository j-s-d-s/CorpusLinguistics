      "\"Don't treat this weekend as a big blow-out\"\n",
      "Wales' two biggest cities will go into lockdown as part of new restrictions being imposed in three areas.\n",
      "Cardiff and the county of Swansea go into lockdown at 18:00 BST on Sunday, 24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli.\n",
      "It means 1.5 million people, about half of Wales' population, will be under lockdown by the end of the weekend.\n",
      "But cases in Caerphilly, the first area to lockdown, have fallen significantly, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said.\n",
      "The restrictions will be the same as those already affecting people living in Merthyr Tydfil, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent, Newport, Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly, which are already in lockdown.\n",
      "Mr Gething said people in Cardiff and Swansea should not \"treat this weekend as a big blow-out\".\n",
      "He also said cases in Carmarthenshire had \"overwhelmingly\" been linked to Llanelli, with eight out of 10 cases there.\n",
      "\"In Llanelli we have a particular challenge around the town that is well identified, a significant spread that is not in control,\" he said at a Welsh Government press conference.\n",
      "\"We've spoken to the local authority, we've spoken to the local health board and we understand the need to act and act as soon as possible.\"\n",
      "What can I do during local lockdowns?\n",
      "Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales\n",
      "Where do the 14.6 million people under new rules live?\n",
      "Rob Stewart, leader of Swansea council, said: \"We have seen a rapid and sharp increase in the number of covid cases in Swansea during the past few weeks.\n",
      "\"So, like much of the population of Wales, we are now in a lockdown. This will mean changes to people's everyday lives but they will help to protect people and our communities.\"\n",

      "The Llanelli lockdown is the first not to cover a whole local authority area. A postcode finder will be made available online to make clear which areas are under lockdown, said Mr Gething.\n",
      "The majority of cases in Llanelli have been linked to people socialising without social distancing.\n",
      "Burry Port, which is also in Carmarthenshire, will not be included in the area under restrictions.\n",
      "Swansea has recorded 63.6 cases per 100,000 people over the past seven days, while Cardiff has recorded 46.1.\n",

      "Meanwhile, cases of coronavirus have been traced to three pubs in Porthcawl, Bridgend county, with customers encouraged to look out for symptoms.\n",
      "PHW said a number of people had tested positive for the virus after visiting The Royal Oak in South Road, The Marine on the Esplanade and The Pier on the Esplanade on the evening of 11 September.\n",
      "Gemma Northey, chairwoman of the multi-agency incident management team for PHW, said anyone who has visited the pubs and been identified as a contact would be contacted by the Test, Trace, Protect team and given further advice.\n",
      "She said those who had visited the pubs and developed symptoms must self-isolate, along with any household members, and book a coronavirus test promptly, but those who were not symptomatic did not need to take action.\n",
      "How do businesses feel?\n",
      "The new restrictions mean people in lockdown can only shop in their own counties, or in the case of Llanelli, their own town.\n",
      "Mike Richards, who owns an antique shop in Llanelli, is angry the town has been singled out.\n",
      "\"It's totally unacceptable,\" he said. \"We're part of Carmarthenshire - the council are supposed to look after us and Carmarthen. \n",
      "\"We'd be goldfish bowls - local customers only - 60% of my trade is from outside Llanelli. I'll have to live with that but I'm not living with Carmarthen having their own way. \n",

      "He said: \"We don't just get people coming from other areas of Wales, but also England.\n",
      "\"We had people from Somerset call earlier who'd arranged to come next week but they can't come anymore.\n",
      "\"I think it will affect a lot of the trade. We prepared for the first lockdown but not so much for the local one.\"\n",
      "What about university students?\n",
      "As students return, Mr Gething said the effect on university towns will be monitored.\n",
      "He said: \"One of the things we'll need to do is to understand how the pattern is changing within those university towns and cities once students have been there for a period of time.\n",
      "\"At this point in time with a large movement of people across the UK, we need to understand what that does in terms of local prevalence so I don't think now is the time to make a definitive choice about what would happen in the end of your recess but it's an obvious question for us to consider.\"\n",
      "What can I do?\n",
      "Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave the eight counties and one town without a \"reasonable excuse\".\n",
      "People are allowed to travel to outside the area for a limited number of reasons.\n",
      "These include going to work if they are not able to work from home, to go to school, give care and buy food or medical supplies.\n",
      "Dr Keith Reid, executive director of public health at Swansea Bay health board, said: \"How long Swansea stays in local lockdown is entirely up to the people of Swansea. You have it in your gift to end this lockdown as early as possible and save lives.\"\n",
      "What about areas not locked down?\n",
      "Aside from the areas being locked down, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales, said Vale of Glamorgan, Carmarthen, Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire and Flintshire were all \"areas of concern to us and we are watching the data from there carefully\".\n",
      "Ministers and officials said they would look at data over the weekend before deciding whether restrictions needed to be extended to Neath Port Talbot, Vale of Glamorgan and Torfaen, Mr Gething said.\n",
      "Meetings will also take place next week with council leaders in north Wales, where Mr Gething said the picture was \"more mixed\".\n",
      "Leader of Neath Port Talbot council, Rob Jones, said it was \"inevitable\" the county would follow neighbouring Swansea into local lockdown if cases continued to rise.\n",
      "Carmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said: \"It is worrying to see how sharply the number of positive cases has risen in the Llanelli area, and action has had to be taken to help stop the spread and break the chain of infections concentrated in this area to prevent a whole county lockdown.\n",
      "\"We must all do the right thing, follow the advice and protect each other. In parts of Llanelli, we're asking people and businesses to make even greater sacrifices - we fully appreciate the impact this will have, but there is no other way. We must stop the spread.\"\n",

      "Mr Biden - who is due to take office on 20 January - also said he expected his inauguration to be a scaled-back event without large crowds because of coronavirus concerns.\n",
      "\"My guess is there'll still be a platform ceremony but I don't know how it's all going to work out,\" he said.\n",
      "What is Biden's policy on vaccines?\n",
      "Pfizer, which says its vaccine has been shown to be 95% effective in clinical trials, and Moderna, which says its jab is 94% effective, have both applied to the Food and Drug Administration to distribute their drugs in the US.\n",
      "The UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine.\n",
      "Earlier on Friday Vice-President Mike Pence said during a visit to Atlanta's CDC that federal approval for a Covid-19 vaccine could be \"a week-and-a-half away.\"\n",
      "media caption\n",
      "How will the new Pfizer vaccine work?\n",
      "Speaking in Wilmington, Delaware, the US president-elect said it would not be necessary to make a coronavirus vaccine mandatory.\n",
      "\"I will do everything in my power as president to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it, demonstrate that it matters,\" he said.\n",
      "The Pew Research Center says just 60% of Americans are currently prepared to take a coronavirus vaccine, up from 51% who said the same in September.\n",
      "On Thursday Mr Biden told CNN he would be happy to take a vaccine in public to allay potential concerns about its safety. Three former presidents - Barack Obama, George W Bush and Bill Clinton - have said they are also prepared to be inoculated publicly.\n",
      "Mr Biden has also reiterated his call for Americans to wear a mask for 100 days - a measure that he said combined with vaccine distribution would see deaths \"drop off the edge\".\n",
      "\"My hope is they will then be inclined to say it's worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people,\" Mr Biden said.\n",
      "Fear of political wrangling\n",
      "The US fight to control the coronavirus pandemic is about to slam head-first into a national anti-vaccine movement that is stubbornly pervasive.\n",
      "That reality may be behind President-elect Biden's statement that he would not support a government mandate that all Americans receive a Covid-19 vaccination. The attempt to implement one - even if supported by science and legal precedent dating back more than a century - could create a groundswell of opposition that would prove counterproductive to public health.\n",
      "Such was the case with mask-wearing - a less intrusive step to prevent the spread of the virus - which, over the past six months, has become infused with politics.\n",
      "Mr Biden, and state governors who would be on the front lines of any such mandate, might prefer to target only certain segments of the population more at risk of contracting or spreading Covid-19. For instance, employers could be encouraged to require healthcare and nursing home workers to be immunised, and most children already must have up-to-date shot records before attending public or private schools.\n",
      "While the speedy development of multiple vaccines has offered reason for hope of more normal life after the coronavirus pandemic, a brewing vaccination fight is just one example of how managing this public-health crisis in the coming months will not be an easy task for the Biden administration.\n",
      "What is the CDC advising Americans to do?\n",
      "The health body said it was now recommending that people wear masks anywhere outside their own homes - including indoors.\n",
      "It said the country was in a phase of \"high-level transmission\" as colder weather was seeing more people spend more time indoors.\n",
      "About half of new cases were the result of transmission from infected people who did not have any symptoms, the CDC said.\n",
      "It said mask wearing, physical distancing and avoiding non-essential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces were part of a \"multi-pronged\" approach needed to \"provide a bridge\" to a future where vaccines were widely available and normal life could resume.\n",

      "The education secretary has defended the decision not to extend the school holidays, insisting it was based \"entirely on public health advice\".\n",
      "John Swinney said there was concern a longer Christmas break could increase transmission out of school.\n",
      "Ministers considered but then rejected a nationwide shutdown of schools from December 18 to January 11.\n",
      "Teachers' leaders have expressed disappointment, pointing out the extra workload created by contact tracing.\n",
      "Both the EIS and NASUWT unions argued that a move to remote learning for a few days before and after the normal scheduled break would have been a safer.\n",
      "With some schools due to continue as late as 23 December, concern has also been raised that some staff could find themselves working in the holiday period.\n",
      "'Organised environment'\n",
      "At the Scottish government's daily coronavirus briefing on Friday, Mr Swinney insisted the decision was solely based on health advice.\n",
      "He said: \"I published the public health advice that I have received on this question, which comes down to one critical point - which is that we can minimise the transmission of the virus between young people if they are in an organised environment like a school as opposed to being in home or community settings.\n",
      "\"To essentially tip the balance and to put more young people into a community setting would be to go against that public health advice.\n",
      "\"So there's no politics involved in this, it's public health advice that I am following.\"\n",
      "image caption\n",
      "John Swinney said he had been advised that formal school settings are less risky than less supervised interaction\n",
      "Regional variations in term dates mean that while some schools break up on 18 December, others are not due to finish until just two days before Christmas.\n",
      "Mr Swinney said the government was working with Public Health Scotland and the National Contact Tracing Centre to make sure \"all school staff and all school teachers can get the break to which they are entitled over the festive season\".\n",
      "He added: \"Obviously I appreciate that some of those closing dates are getting quite close to Christmas Day.\"\n",
      "Jane Peckham, from the Scotland branch of the NASUWT said the rumours about a possible extension to the Christmas break had raised expectations and anxiety among the teaching profession.\n",
      "She said: \"This announcement yesterday indicates yet again that government have no intention to use the promised contingency of blended learning, even in the highest Covid-19 level areas.\n",
      "\"Remote learning could have been a solution to maintaining education provision whilst reducing the risk of virus transmission in the run-up to Christmas.\n",
      "\"Ministers now need urgently to set out what arrangements should be in place to support those having to manage the Test and Protect system over Christmas.\"\n",
      "Extra hours\n",
      "The EIS teaching union said school management teams were often working long additional hours due to the demands of contact tracing.\n",
      "Lorraine McBride, convenor of the union's head teacher and deputy head teacher network, said: \"It is concrete support that we need - not just fine words from the Scottish government or our employers telling us how much they appreciate us.\"\n",
      "She said many head teachers and deputies were \"devastated\" by the decision not to move to remote learning for the final week of term.\n",
      "\"This decision means that, where positive cases are identified late, school management teams may be expected to deliver or support contact tracing work over the Christmas period,\" she added.\n",
      "\"The Scottish government's decision also significantly increases the risk of pupils and staff taking the virus into their homes, or into the homes of potentially vulnerable family members, during the festive period.\"\n",
      "Mr Swinney, who is also deputy first minister, used the daily briefing to announce an extension of rates relief for nurseries.\n",
      "The move means 100% relief on non-domestic rates for nurseries until at least June 2023.\n",
      "The relief began in April 2018 and had been due to end in March next year.\n",
