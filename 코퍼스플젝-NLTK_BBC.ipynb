      "['Is the Covid vaccine safe \\nUK regulators have approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use \\nBut while many people want an injection as soon as possible  others are worried about putting something unknown into their bodies  How do we know a vaccine is safe  This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment  Safety trials begin in the lab  with tests and research on cells and animals  before moving on to human studies  The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns How will I get a coronavirus vaccine  How does the Oxford vaccine compare  Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it  Your Questions Answered  How do we know the vaccine is safe  What role do trials have \\nAs long as the safety data from the labs is good  scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective too  That means tests on large numbers of volunteers   around 40 000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech  In trials  half of the people are given the vaccine and the other half a dummy or placebo jab  The researchers and participants are not told which group is which  until after the results have been analysed  to avoid bias  All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently  The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed  but they haven\\'t skipped any of these steps  The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine trial was voluntarily put on hold at one stage to investigate why one participant   out of many thousands   had died  It restarted once it was clear it was not related to the vaccine  Who approves vaccines or treatments  Approval will only be given for a vaccine if the government regulator  the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  MHRA   is happy that it\\'s both safe and effective  The MHRA is part of the Department of Health  and employs more than 1 200 people  Its head is Dr June Raine  who has spent her career working in medicine regulation \\nIn becoming the first agency in the world to approve a coronavirus vaccine  Dr Raine said  \"The public can be absolutely confident that the standards we have worked to are equivalent to those around the world\"  Checks on the vaccine will continue to make sure there are no further side effects or long term risks  If anyone suspects they are suffering a side effect from a vaccination  they can report it to the MHRA  Independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it first\\nIt has drawn up interim advice on priority groups for the Covid vaccine and how many doses to use  The JCVI  which has about 20 members who are experts on vaccines  is led by Prof Andrew Pollard  who works at the University of Oxford  What\\'s in the Covid vaccines  There are lots of different Covid vaccines in development  Some contain the pandemic virus itself in a weakened form  The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like Sars CoV 2   the virus that causes Covid 19  Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna\\'s vaccines use bits of genetic code to cause an immune response  and are called mRNA vaccines  These do not alter human cells  They only present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid \\nSome Covid jabs contain proteins from coronavirus  Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients  like aluminium  that make the vaccine stable or more effective  Will a vaccine make me ill  There is no evidence that any of these ingredients cause harm when used in such small amounts  Vaccines do not give you a disease  Instead  they teach your body\\'s immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against  Some people do suffer mild symptoms  such as muscle aches or a bit of a temperature  after being vaccinated  This is not the disease itself  but the body\\'s response to the vaccine  Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare  For any approved vaccine  the ingredients will be listed  Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed  who advises the MHRA  said it hadn\\'t identified any \"serious adverse reactions\" during the trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine  He said  \"Most of the adverse effects were mild and short lasting  usually lasting for a day or two  similar to the kind of effects you get after any other vaccine\" \\nHe added that the MHRA had a \"vigilant\" strategy to carry on monitoring the safety of the vaccine  Be aware that anti vaccine stories are spread online through social media  These posts are not based on scientific advice  or blend facts with misinformation   Is it safe for someone who had Covid to have the vaccine  Once a coronavirus vaccine is approved  it is likely that people will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid 19 in the past  That\\'s because natural immunity may not be long lived and immunisation could offer more protection  Guidance from Public Health England says there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with long Covid either  But people who are currently unwell with Covid 19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered  How animal friendly are vaccines  Some vaccines  such as the shingles vaccine and the children\\'s nasal flu vaccine  can contain pork gelatine  And some vaccines are grown on hen\\'s eggs  or cells from chick embryos  There are hundreds of Covid vaccines in development  We don\\'t have details on every ingredient yet  but many of the Covid vaccines are expected to be vegetarian or vegan friendly  If everyone else gets vaccinated then surely I don\\'t need to bother  There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections  Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives  The first doses that become available will probably be offered to people with the highest need   such as the elderly   who could become severely ill  It is not yet clear how much protection vaccines might give in terms of stopping people from spreading Covid  If they can do this well  vaccinating enough people would stamp out the disease \\nCovid  Llandovery Hospital closed amid Covid outbreaks A community hospital in west Wales has been shut due to coronavirus outbreaks at two hospitals  a health board said  Llandovery Hospital in Carmarthenshire is closed and its patients transferred to Amman Valley Hospital in Ammanford  Hywel Dda health board has announced  It said a number of staff at both hospitals were self isolating after testing positive for Covid 19  creating \"significant constraints\" on staff  Llandovery mayor Louise Wride said it was a \"big concern\" for the community  Public Health Wales reported 151 new cases in the health board area on Wednesday   90 of which were in Carmarthenshire  \"It is a main topic on the street here   I\\'m not sure if it\\'s because we\\'re a small community but there seems to be more cases now \" said Ms Wride  \"We\\'re pulling together as a community though  trying to help each other \" Dozens of health staff abused \\'for wearing PPE\\' Rising Covid care home deaths add to total One of the main concerns in the community  according to Ms Wride  is that the hospital may mot reopen after a campaign to save it from closure last year \\n\\'A big concern\\' \"It is a big concern for us in Llandovery   it\\'s a big hub for the town \" she went on \\n\"The worst case scenario is that it would close permanently   that would be a big loss in Llandovery  but we have been assured it will be re opening in January \" Eight doctors from the Llanfair surgery  which is based on the hospital site  have written a letter explaining the decision \\n\"This was not a decision which anyone would have wished to implement  but it was the only sensible conclusion \" the letter said  \"Due to the critical nursing staff shortages because of illness  this was the safest decision for all patients \" The health board said there would be \"no increased risk to any patients\" at Amman Valley hospital  and envisaged reopening Llandovery Hospital in early January \"once staffing levels have returned to normal\" \\nCovid  Jersey to enter \\'hospitality circuit breaker\\'\\nPubs  bars and restaurants in Jersey are set to close from 00 01 GMT on Friday for up to a month in order to tackle a surge in Covid cases \\nThe \"hospitality circuit breaker\" announced on Wednesday comes amid fears health services could be overwhelmed \\nFood and hospitality outlets  except takeaways  will have to shut \\nAll shops can stay open  but indoor sport and fitness classes and gyms must close and the 2m  6 6ft  distancing law is to be brought back into force \\nChief Minister John Le Fondre said the recent rise in cases on the island presented \"a real and immediate risk to health services    and islanders\\' lives\" \\nThe circuit breaker measures are expected to remain in place until 4 January \\nOne pub owner said measures should have been introduced sooner to try to save jobs and Christmas trade for the hospitality industry  \\'More stringent restrictions\\'\\nThere are currently 331 active cases on Jersey with the majority   231   symptomatic and eight cases being treated in hospital \\nOn Wednesday  56 new Covid cases were identified  the biggest daily total of new infections recorded so far \\nSenator Le Fondre said Jersey\\'s R number was currently between 1 4 and 1 9  which \"means each case is  on average  passing the infection on to more than one other person\" \\n\"This is too much and we need to introduce more stringent restrictions to protect islanders \"\\nJersey \"now stands at an important crossroads in our pandemic response\"  Senator Le Fondre said  adding  \"I know that collectively these measures represent a significant restriction   particularly at this time of year  when we want to be celebrating and spending time with loved ones and friends \\n\"But we need to prevent our health services from being overwhelmed  and ensure we are still able to celebrate during the festive period \"\\nSupport for affected businesses would be provided under the co funded payroll scheme  according to the chief minister \\nSean Murphy  who runs the Lamplighter Pub in St Helier  said the move should have come \"a lot earlier to try save Christmas\" \\nHe said having to close over Christmas and the new year would cost people their jobs and the industry thousands of pounds \\n\"Everybody in hospitality understands the reasoning of it because of Covid  but it\\'s the timing of the closure \" Mr Murphy said \\nAnalysis  Freddie Miller  Political Reporter  BBC News\\nWhen Jersey\\'s politicians agreed in July to reopen the borders  there were no known active cases of the virus \\nAnd while the numbers increased in the following months  many felt the situation was under control   largely thanks to a system of rapid border testing \\nBut within days  the mood has changed significantly \\nThe number of cases has more than doubled since 25 November  with a series of parties and social events blamed \\nAmid growing concerns about the ability of the health service to cope  these restrictions were announced just 48 hours after a previous tightening of the rules  and the day after masks were made mandatory in shops and supermarkets \\nThe government insists it has acted decisively \\nBut many have criticised ministers\\' reaction  with one prominent backbencher arguing they have \"dithered since late October\" \\nAnd while some will see the closure of hospitality as an over reaction  with Christmas just three weeks away  others believe it is too little  too late  Extra measures\\nRules on households mixing over Christmas will be announced in the next few days \\nHealth Minister Deputy Richard Renouf warned the island would need to open its Nightingale hospital if cases continued to rise \\nJersey\\'s General Hospital closed to all visitors at 17 00 on Wednesday  while high risk islanders have been told to adopt \"extra measures\"  including avoiding visits to other people\\'s homes \\nDeputy Renouf also said officials were in \"close discussions\" with the UK following its approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine \\nWho will get the Covid vaccine first \\nThe UK has become the first country in the world to approve mass use of a Covid vaccine for people aged 16 and over  Immunisations with the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine  approved by the British medicines regulator  the MHRA  could start early next week for people in some high priority groups  with 800 000 doses arriving in the UK in the first delivery \\nNine groups of at risk people have been prioritised to have the vaccine in the first phase  with care home residents and workers at the top and frontline health workers next \\nHowever  logistical challenges with ultra cold storage and transport of the jab means getting it to care homes may take a bit longer \\nProf Jonathan Van Tam  England\\'s deputy chief medical officer  said there would be \"blending of the top two groups\" because of technical issues with a \"delicate\" vaccine \\nAnd he suggested that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine  which is waiting for approval from the UK regulator  would be easier to roll out in care homes and would \"hopefully be approved before Christmas\"  When will I get a vaccine \\nSir Simon Stevens  chief executive of NHS England  said the vaccine rollout will start at 50 \"hospital hubs\" in England next week  NHS staff  care home staff and the over 80s are likely to get them first \\nGP practices will operate local vaccination centres as stocks become available  And   if regulators give approval for a safe way of splitting the packs of 975 doses   care homes will receive stocks \\nBut Sir Simon said that process may not take long   and the \"first tranche\" of care home vaccinations could happen this month  \"with a fair wind\" \\nHe added that people due in hospital next week for an outpatient appointment may also be invited to get the vaccine \\nThe priority groups   around a quarter of the population   cover 90 99% of those at risk of dying from Covid 19  according to the JCVI \\nThe older you are  the higher your risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from the virus   and that risk rises sharply beyond 70  People with underlying health conditions are also vulnerable to the virus \\nAfter these nine priority groups  there will be a second phase of vaccination for younger groups in the population \\nLocal NHS and public health teams will be given some flexibility to allocate vaccines to other at risk groups  including people from ethnic backgrounds and deprived communities \\nPeople will be vaccinated twice   21 days apart   and full immunity starts seven days after the second dose  Where will I get a vaccine \\nYou\\'ll be invited to book an appointment to get a vaccine as soon as it\\'s your turn  probably by letter \\nIn England  as well as hospitals  more than 1 000 GP surgeries will act as local vaccination centres  and sports stadiums and conference centres will act as major vaccination hubs \\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon says the first vaccines will be administered on Tuesday in Scotland \\nNorthern Ireland will receive 25 000 doses next week and NHS staff have been told they will be vaccinated on 14 December  although this could be brought forward \\nThe roll out of the vaccine in Wales will start in a matter of days \\nThe NHS is recruiting 30 000 volunteers to help with the rollout  including lifeguards  airline staff and students   who will be trained to give the jabs  I\\'m pregnant   should I be vaccinated \\nFor precautionary reasons  and because the vaccine was not tested on pregnant women during the trials  the official advice is that you should wait until after the birth of your baby \\nThere is no suggestion the advice is because of any safety concerns with the vaccine \\nPregnant women are likely to be low down the list of priority groups anyway because of their age  and may only be offered a vaccine in the second phase in 2021  Can I pay to be vaccinated sooner \\nNo   this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS \\nYou can\\'t jump the queue by paying for it  but there should be plenty of vaccine to go round  Should I leave a gap between getting the flu and Covid vaccines \\nIf you\\'re eligible for a flu vaccine  you should get it as soon as possible  particularly if you will also be in a high risk priority group for a Covid jab \\nHaving both infections at once this winter could be dangerous \\nAt its last meeting  the JCVI recommended leaving at least seven days between the vaccines \\nFlu jab \\'more important than ever\\' this winter Will the Covid vaccine be safe \\nThe UK medicines regulator does not authorise any vaccine unless it believes it is safe \\nThe MHRA assesses all the data  ensures a vaccine works and that all the necessary trials and checks have been completed \\nIt studies  lab and clinical trial results manufacturing and quality controls product sampling testing of the final product The regulator is doing this as quickly as possible without cutting corners  because these vaccines are a priority \\nDrug companies making the vaccines have been sending trial data to the regulator regularly since their trials started  which has also shortened the process \\nThe MHRA also seeks advice from another independent body  the Commission on Human Medicines  before advising the government on a potential vaccine \\nThe Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is the fastest ever to go from concept to reality  taking just 10 months \\nThe Oxford AstraZeneca team has now sent all the data on its vaccine to the MHRA for approval  as has Moderna  and other vaccine developers will follow \\nIn the event the UK has a choice  the JCVI would advise which vaccine should be used for different groups of people  Where is the vaccine made \\nThe Pfizer BioNTech vaccine  which is the first to be approved in the UK  is being manufactured and distributed from Belgium \\nThe vaccine will be packed in specially designed \"thermoboxes\" containing dry ice  and transported to the UK by lorry or plane \\nIt will go straight to major hospitals to be stored at freezing temperatures of about  70C  which is required to keep the vaccine stable \\nIt can only be moved once from there  and must be kept in batches of 1 000 doses \\nAt that point  it\\'s a race against time   they can be kept at fridge temperatures  2 8C  for five days and up to six hours in a cool bag to enable them to be taken to care homes and other sites \\nSome of the first delivery of the Pfizer vaccine is understood to be travelling via the Eurotunnel to the UK on Thursday  Will everyone be vaccinated \\nThe eventual aim is that as many people as possible over the age of 16 receive a Covid 19 vaccine \\nThat would be more than 50 million people   a huge challenge \\nThere is no timeframe on this momentous task  but it\\'s clear that\\'s the long term plan in 2021 \\nThe NHS has plenty of experience delivering vaccines to huge numbers of people  for example this winter\\'s flu jab should reach 30 million \\nA Covid vaccine won\\'t be compulsory though   no other vaccines in the UK are  and experts say this approach doesn\\'t help create confidence in the vaccine \\nAt present  the government has ordered seven different types of vaccine and expects to receive 355 million doses  including 100 million of the Oxford/AstraZeneca one \\nIf everyone needs two doses  that would certainly be enough for every adult in the UK \\nCovid  Greggs factory closes amid outbreak\\nA Greggs factory has ceased production after an outbreak of coronavirus \\nThe bakery chain said a \"small number\" of workers at its Longbenton site  near Newcastle  had tested positive for Covid 19 \\nIt was unable to confirm how many of the 300 staff employed at the site were affected \\nThe site at Balliol Business Park will undergo a \"thorough clean\"  a spokesman said  adding that Greggs \"do not foresee\" any stock shortages in shops \\nNo date for re opening has yet been set \\nLink between Covid cluster and call centre outbreak\\nA link has been established between a cluster of Covid 19 cases in Inverclyde and an earlier outbreak at a call centre in Lanarkshire \\nNHS Greater Glasgow said 13 people had tested positive in the health board area  a rise of two since Thursday \\nIt also confirmed that one of those cases was linked to the Sitel call centre outbreak in Motherwell \\nStaff at M&D Green Pharmacy in Port Glasgow have tested positive as well as a worker at Amazon\\'s Gourock site \\nSome individuals visited a number of businesses in the Greater Glasgow area  and health officials have warned they may have been infectious at the time  Thirteen people now positive in Covid cluster Pharmacy linked to Inverclyde Covid 19 cluster Nineteen Covid cases linked to call centre\\nThe businesses included The Botany bar and restaurant in Maryhill Road  Glasgow  and Sweeney\\'s Cruises in West Dunbartonshire  both on Sunday \\nIndividuals also visited The Queen of the Loch by Marston\\'s Inn in Balloch and Lomond Woods Holiday Park on the weekend of 24 July \\nAll the businesses linked to the outbreak are continuing to operate but staff from the pharmacy who have tested positive are not currently working there \\nThe health board has said the cases were only experiencing mild symptoms  Close contacts\\nDr Daniel Carter  a consultant in public health medicine who is chairing the incident management team  said  \"All those who have tested positive for Covid 19 have been given appropriate advice and are self isolating \\n\"We are working with a number of businesses including a local pharmacy to trace any close contacts \"\\nIn a statement on Facebook  Sweeney\\'s Cruises said they were visited by council health officials and had been \"given the green light to carry on with our daily cruises\" \\nQueen Of The Loch and Marston\\'s Inn said on Facebook that it had \"enhanced cleaning procedures in place\"  had undergone a \"full deep clean\" and was co operating with the local authority \\nNone of the cases linked to the pharmacy are currently working there and customers have been told it is safe to keep using its facilities \\nOn Thursday  Inverclyde Council leader Stephen McCabe said news of the local cluster was \"soul destroying\" in an area which had already been one of the worst hit by coronavirus in Scotland \\n\"There has been a lot of anxiety  rightly  in the community over the last few months \" he said \\n\"But there is a degree of reassurance that the effective systems are in place and hopefully we can contain the virus \" Control measures\\nM&D Green managing director Martin Green previously aid \"some staff\" at its John Wood Street branch had tested positive for Covid 19 \\nHe said  \"We have been working with Health Protection Scotland and environmental health officers  who are satisfied with the infection control measures we have in place and have immediately implemented the minor additional actions recommended \"\\nMr Green added  \"We have been reassured by the local outbreak management team that these measures allow us to continue to provide the full range of pharmaceutical services without any risk to the public \"In a statement  Amazon said it was supporting the individual in quarantine and were following guidelines from health officials about operations at their buildings \\nIt added  \"We have implemented proactive measures to protect employees  including increased cleaning at all facilities and maintaining social distance \"\\nCovid in Scotland  NHS staff \\'facing perfect storm\\'\\nScotland\\'s NHS is \"facing a perfect storm\" as staff shortages and a lack of hospital beds hamper efforts to tackle rising numbers of coronavirus cases  according to a leading physician \\nProf Jackie Taylor said a \"coherent strategy\" for testing staff and all hospital patients was needed \\nShe also called for more flexibility for under pressure services to be able to reduce non urgent procedures \\nThe Scottish government said plans were in place to deal with peak demand \\nProf Taylor  who is president of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow  told BBC Scotland there needed to be \"an open and transparent conversation about prioritisation of work\" as winter approached  Man claims father caught Covid in hospital and died Royal college elects first female leader Are infection rates slowing in Scotland  No rule changes planned before next week\\nNicola Sturgeon said at her daily briefing on Tuesday that there were some \"encouraging signs\" that coronavirus was coming back under control in Scotland \\nThe first minister said measures around home visits and hospitality taken in September and October appear to be bearing fruit  with the rate of increase in new cases slowing in recent weeks \\nThe latest 24 hour period saw another 999 positive cases recorded  while the number of hospital patients with a confirmed case of Covid 19 rose by 29 to 1 254  with 92 being treated in intensive care \\nThere are two things that are striking when talking to NHS staff working in the worst hit areas \\nThe first is energy levels  In the spring there was a real drive to pull together to get through the first wave  This time round there is much more anxiety and fatigue  Long standing workforce shortages in the health service are now exacerbated by staff off sick or having to isolate because of Covid \\nThe second thing is having to step in when relatives cannot visit  Not only are staff having to break bad news over the phone  or facilitate impersonal virtual visits; but they can be the only regular personal contact that a patient might have \\nIt\\'s something almost every member of staff brings up  no matter what they do and which department they work in  and that is taking an emotional toll \\nProf Taylor acknowledged there were \"some green shoots which tell us the number of new cases is plateauing\" but underlined that the total number of people requiring hospital treatment \"has not yet begun to plateau\" \\n\"Speaking to colleagues across the central belt in particular and the health boards which have the highest number of cases  we really feel as though we are facing a perfect storm \" she said \\n\"Let\\'s remember the rate of increase may be less steep but at present the number of cases day on day are still rising  So we have a significant number of cases  we have a shortage of beds and we have significant staff shortages because of illness and staff isolating \\n\"Obviously winter is always busier  and we are facing those months now  We are still trying to maintain some elective and other urgent and non urgent work as well  so it really is a perfect storm \"\\nShe added  \"My colleagues at the frontline are certainly facing absolutely enormous challenges \"\\nThe Scottish government will assess progress on the spread of the virus ahead of a scheduled review point next Tuesday before deciding on any changes to restrictions \\n\"Clearly we do need to reduce community transmissions \" Prof Taylor said  \"All the efforts being made in that regard are absolutely right and we need people to stick with 100% of the guidelines 100% of the time \\n\"We also need permission  where services are becoming exceptionally challenged  to be able to flex the amount of elective and non urgent work  That will be different across Scotland but certainly services under pressure need to be given permission to reduce some of those procedures and operations \" Covid in Scotland  Where are the latest cases  Covid rules  What\\'s law and what\\'s not \\nShe added  \"There appears to be a disconnect between the experiences of frontline clinicians and the perceptions of health boards  There needs to be an open and transparent conversation about prioritisation of work \\n\"We also need to try to get on top of infections within hospitals by testing all patients   irrespective of age   at the front door  because many don\\'t have typical symptoms  And we absolutely must get some coherent strategy for testing staff \"\\nSince June  asymptomatic healthcare staff in some specialist wards such as oncology wards have been offered weekly tests \\nConcerns were raised several weeks ago that staff in Scotland were not getting results quickly enough  with a Scottish government spokeswoman saying they took just over 27 hours on average when processed within the same health board \\nA Scottish government spokesman said  \"Our over riding priority continues to be that the NHS is not overwhelmed in the coming weeks and months  We continue to work closely with all health deal with a range of pressures on capacity  including Covid 19 \\n\"We can re purpose approximately 3 000 acute beds nationally as part of our contingency planning  including the ability to double their ICU capacity to 360 within one week  treble to 585 in two weeks and  if required  extend this to over 700  subject to staff and supplies \"\\nHe said mutual aid arrangements were also in place between NHS boards to ensure there was enough capacity to deal with peak levels of demand \\n\"In addition  NHS Louisa Jordan stands ready to help manage any additional demand of Covid 19 patients for hospitals by providing care for individuals who have tested positive  require hospitalisation  but are in a stable condition and do not need critical care \" the spokesman said \\nCovid in Scotland  Where are the latest cases \\nThere have been 97 720 confirmed cases of Covid 19 in Scotland and 3 848 people have died following a positive test for the virus  according to Scottish government figures \\nThis page is updated regularly and analyses the key figures for the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland \\nFigures updated at 14 00 on 3 December 2020  Confirmed cases of Covid 19\\nOver the past seven days there have been 5 534 cases detected following a test  with 958 confirmed on Thursday \\nThis next chart shows the number of daily confirmed cases after an NHS Scotland or UK government test since 1 August  along with a seven day average \\nThe actual number of people infected since February will be far higher than the overall confirmed cases figure  as most people who had Covid 19 during the peak of the outbreak were not tested \\nScotland\\'s \"second wave\" has seen a much bigger surge in the number of cases because many more people are being tested  How many cases are there in my area \\nThe weekly number of positive tests per 100 000 people in each of Scotland\\'s 32 local authorities is now a key indicator of which Covid level a council area will be placed in \\nThe most recent data often underestimates the number of positive tests as there are sometimes delays before results are recorded  so this chart uses figures from four days ago \\nLooking at the total number of cases by health board  the highest number has been in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde  reflecting the fact it is the most populous part of Scotland  Deaths from Covid 19 The first coronavirus death in Scotland was reported by NHS Lothian on 13 March and the number of daily deaths peaked on 15 April when 84 were reported  Over the summer  Scotland went for a long period when there were no deaths following a positive test for Covid 19  but the rate of new deaths rose again in the autumn  There are three ways to measure deaths from Covid 19 \\nThe Scottish government\\'s daily announcement counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test for Covid 19  whereas the National Records of Scotland  NRS  counts all death certificates that mention Covid 19  even if the person has not been tested for the virus \\nThe coronavirus death toll in Scotland\\nThe NRS also publishes monthly data on excess deaths in 2020  compared with a five year average  How many people are in hospital \\nAt its peak in the spring  the coronavirus outbreak created a huge load on Scotland\\'s hospitals  with more than 1 500 patients in hospital and over 200 being treated on intensive care wards \\nNumbers reduced over the summer  but rose steadily again throughout the autumn before starting to decline again \\nOnly patients who test positive during their current stay in hospital  or in the two weeks before their admission  are counted by the Scottish government as Covid 19 patients \\nThey are no longer classified as Covid patients after 28 days in hospital or 28 days after their positive test  whichever is later  How is the share of positive tests changing \\nThe World Health Organisation  WHO  says the percentage of positive test results is a key measure when assessing the status of a Covid 19 outbreak within a country \\nThe organisation has stated that if less than 5% of samples from a comprehensive testing system return a positive result over two weeks then it is one indication an epidemic is under control \\nOther indications include a continuous decline in hospital admissions and a decline in the number of new deaths over at least three weeks \\nThis chart shows the \"positivity rate\" in Scotland since 18 August \\nThe Scottish government changed the way it measures this rate on 19 October \\nPreviously  the government calculated it by dividing the number of positive cases with the number of newly tested individuals each day \\nHowever  it now calculates the rate using the number of positive tests reported each day \\nThe Scottish government said it changed the method to bring it into line with the WHO\\'s criteria  and because the previous measure was \"likely to over estimate the positivity rate\" as more people were repeatedly tested  What is the estimated R number in Scotland \\nThe R number  or reproduction number  is a way of rating a disease\\'s ability to spread  It is the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to \\nIf the reproduction number is higher than one  then the number of cases increases exponentially \\nThe Scottish government has been monitoring the estimated R number in Scotland since the start of the outbreak \\nCovid  Lockdowns for Cardiff  Swansea and Llanelli\\nWales\\' two biggest cities will go into lockdown as part of new restrictions being imposed in three areas \\nCardiff and the county of Swansea go into lockdown at 18 00 BST on Sunday  24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli \\nIt means 1 5 million people  about half of Wales\\' population  will be under lockdown by the end of the weekend \\nBut cases in Caerphilly  the first area to lockdown  have fallen significantly  Health Minister Vaughan Gething said \\nThe restrictions will be the same as those already affecting people living in Merthyr Tydfil  Bridgend  Blaenau Gwent  Newport  Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly  which are already in lockdown \\nMr Gething said people in Cardiff and Swansea should not \"treat this weekend as a big blow out\" \\nHe also said cases in Carmarthenshire had \"overwhelmingly\" been linked to Llanelli  with eight out of 10 cases there \\n\"In Llanelli we have a particular challenge around the town that is well identified  a significant spread that is not in control \" he said at a Welsh Government press conference \\n\"We\\'ve spoken to the local authority  we\\'ve spoken to the local health board and we understand the need to act and act as soon as possible \"\\nRob Stewart  leader of Swansea council  said  \"We have seen a rapid and sharp increase in the number of covid cases in Swansea during the past few weeks \\n\"So  like much of the population of Wales  we are now in a lockdown  This will mean changes to people\\'s everyday lives but they will help to protect people and our communities \"\\nHe described a \"balanced judgement\" being taken that the rules should come into force in Cardiff and Swansea a day later to \"allow people to plan\" \\nIn the past seven days  85 of 109 cases in Carmarthenshire have been in Llanelli where the rate of infection is 151 6 per 100 000 people  compared to 57 7 in the wider county \\nThe Llanelli lockdown is the first not to cover a whole local authority area  A postcode finder will be made available online to make clear which areas are under lockdown  said Mr Gething \\nThe majority of cases in Llanelli have been linked to people socialising without social distancing \\nBurry Port  which is also in Carmarthenshire  will not be included in the area under restrictions \\nSwansea has recorded 63 6 cases per 100 000 people over the past seven days  while Cardiff has recorded 46 1 \\nThe seven day case rate for the whole of Wales is just shy of 57 per 100 000 \\nMeanwhile  cases of coronavirus have been traced to three pubs in Porthcawl  Bridgend county  with customers encouraged to look out for symptoms \\nPHW said a number of people had tested positive for the virus after visiting The Royal Oak in South Road  The Marine on the Esplanade and The Pier on the Esplanade on the evening of 11 September \\nGemma Northey  chairwoman of the multi agency incident management team for PHW  said anyone who has visited the pubs and been identified as a contact would be contacted by the Test  Trace  Protect team and given further advice \\nShe said those who had visited the pubs and developed symptoms must self isolate  along with any household members  and book a coronavirus test promptly  but those who were not symptomatic did not need to take action  How do businesses feel \\nThe new restrictions mean people in lockdown can only shop in their own counties  or in the case of Llanelli  their own town \\nMike Richards  who owns an antique shop in Llanelli  is angry the town has been singled out \\n\"It\\'s totally unacceptable \" he said  \"We\\'re part of Carmarthenshire   the council are supposed to look after us and Carmarthen  \\n\"We\\'d be goldfish bowls   local customers only   60% of my trade is from outside Llanelli  I\\'ll have to live with that but I\\'m not living with Carmarthen having their own way  \\n\"With respect  everywhere else they\\'ve locked down an area  We\\'ll be the first town to lock down  Why \"\\nMatteo Moruzzi  from Verdi\\'s cafe in Mumbles  Swansea  said the lack of tourism would hit the business hard \\nHe said  \"We don\\'t just get people coming from other areas of Wales  but also England \\n\"We had people from Somerset call earlier who\\'d arranged to come next week but they can\\'t come anymore \\n\"I think it will affect a lot of the trade  We prepared for the first lockdown but not so much for the local one \" What about university students \\nAs students return  Mr Gething said the effect on university towns will be monitored \\nHe said  \"One of the things we\\'ll need to do is to understand how the pattern is changing within those university towns and cities once students have been there for a period of time \\n\"At this point in time with a large movement of people across the UK  we need to understand what that does in terms of local prevalence so I don\\'t think now is the time to make a definitive choice about what would happen in the end of your recess but it\\'s an obvious question for us to consider \" What can I do \\nUnder the rules  nobody is able to enter or leave the eight counties and one town without a \"reasonable excuse\" \\nPeople are allowed to travel to outside the area for a limited number of reasons \\nThese include going to work if they are not able to work from home  to go to school  give care and buy food or medical supplies \\nDr Keith Reid  executive director of public health at Swansea Bay health board  said  \"How long Swansea stays in local lockdown is entirely up to the people of Swansea  You have it in your gift to end this lockdown as early as possible and save lives \" What about areas not locked down \\nAside from the areas being locked down  Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales  said Vale of Glamorgan  Carmarthen  Anglesey  Conwy  Denbighshire and Flintshire were all \"areas of concern to us and we are watching the data from there carefully\" \\nMinisters and officials said they would look at data over the weekend before deciding whether restrictions needed to be extended to Neath Port Talbot  Vale of Glamorgan and Torfaen  Mr Gething said \\nMeetings will also take place next week with council leaders in north Wales  where Mr Gething said the picture was \"more mixed\" \\nLeader of Neath Port Talbot council  Rob Jones  said it was \"inevitable\" the county would follow neighbouring Swansea into local lockdown if cases continued to rise \\nCarmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said  \"It is worrying to see how sharply the number of positive cases has risen in the Llanelli area  and action has had to be taken to help stop the spread and break the chain of infections concentrated in this area to prevent a whole county lockdown \\n\"We must all do the right thing  follow the advice and protect each other  In parts of Llanelli  we\\'re asking people and businesses to make even greater sacrifices   we fully appreciate the impact this will have  but there is no other way  We must stop the spread \"\\nCovid 19 deaths pass 3 000 in Wales\\nThe number of deaths involving Covid 19 has now exceeded 3 000 in Wales  according to the Office for National Statistics \\nThere were 166 deaths involving Covid registered in the latest weekly figures   20% of the total of all deaths \\nMeanwhile  another 31 deaths linked to hospital infection outbreaks have been reported by Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board \\nThey include 17 deaths at the Princess of Wales in Bridgend \\nAnother nine deaths occurred at Prince Charles hospital in Merthyr and five at the Royal Glamorgan hospital  in the week up to Monday \\nAltogether there are 597 cases across the health board\\'s hospitals  an increase on last week \\nDeaths overall in Wales were a third above average in the week to 6 November  according to the ONS \\nSo called excess deaths   a key indicator of how the pandemic is progressing   shows there were 207 deaths more than the five year average \\nThis is 33% higher than average  which is the highest proportion in England and Wales after north west England for the latest week \\nDeaths involving Covid 19 were up 45 compared to the number registered the week before \\nThere were 62 deaths registered across the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area involving coronavirus   including 53 in hospital \\nThere have been 127 deaths from Covid 19 infections caught in hospital outbreaks up to last week \\nThere were also 49 deaths in the Aneurin Bevan health board area  24 in Swansea Bay  12 in Betsi Cadwaladr and 12 in Cardiff and Vale \\nThere were five deaths in Hywel Dda and two hospital deaths involving Powys residents \\nThe figures show  The total number of Covid deaths up to and registered by 6 November was 3 050 When deaths registered over the following few days are counted  there was a total of 3 119 deaths Rhondda Cynon Taf  RCT  with 433 deaths has now overtaken Cardiff  430  with the largest number of deaths There were 23 deaths involving confirmed or suspected Covid 19 in care homes in the latest week   the highest number in five months\\nRCT\\'s death rate   when population size is taken into consideration   is the third highest across England and Wales  at 180 deaths per 100 000  while Merthyr Tydfil has now moved into the worst 10 areas \\'There are people saying \\'is Covid real \\'\\nIris Davies  69  from Ynyshir  Rhondda  died recently from Covid 19 and her granddaughter Molly Evans said it was like losing a best friend  describing her as someone who \"loved life and lived her best life\" \\n\"She was the most family orientated person  the glue of our family   she was also the most outgoing person  a social person before all this happened \" said Molly  23 \\n\"We went to watch musicals  she came to watch me at the eisteddfod  at football \"\\nIris died at the beginning of the firebreak lockdown after losing her best friend to coronavirus two months before  so Molly says her grandmother had talked about death \\nThe family did their best to protect her and take all the right precautions  but Molly believes the geography of the Rhondda community and its close knit nature brings people closer together  and this may be a factor for its high death rate \\n\"When it sinks in  it\\'s devastating \" she said  \"It\\'s hard to accept because I log on to social media and there are people saying \\'is Covid real \\'\\n\"I\\'ve seen her with my own eyes  on a ventilator  Between breaths she was still trying to make a joke of things  She was fighting so much \"\\nMedical statistician Dr Rhian Daniel  of Cardiff University  told BBC Wales\\' Newyddion programme that more detailed analysis was needed  but the number of public facing jobs  including care work  as well as low paid jobs could all play a part in the big differences in mortality between places such as Rhondda Cynon Taf and Merthyr and areas such as Pembrokeshire \\n\"Chance can play a big role  but there are likely to be more structural reasons   occupation might be an important factor \" she added  Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Covid 19 deaths at highest level since June Mouthwash \\'can kill Covid in lab in 30 seconds\\' Two more Covid deaths and 892 new cases\\nDeaths counted

oversee rollout of the Covid vaccine in England \\nThe rollout is expected to begin before Christmas  subject to regulatory approval \\nMr Zahawi  MP for Stratford on Avon  will oversee distribution of the vaccine until at least next summer \\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he was \"delighted\"  adding in a tweet there was \"an enormous task ahead\" \\nUnder the interim arrangement  Mr Zahawi will serve as a joint minister between the health department and the business department  where he currently works \\nHis primary focus will be on delivering the vaccine  with most areas of his business portfolio put aside \\nIt comes as a further 479 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported in the UK  bringing the total to 58 030  There were also a further 15 871 positive cases registered in the past 24 hours \\nIn a tweet  Mr Zahawi welcomed his new post but said the rollout would be a \"big responsibility and a big operational challenge\" \\nHe added that he was \"absolutely committed to making sure we can roll out vaccines quickly   saving lives and livelihoods and helping us #buildbackbetter\" \\nMr Zahawi will look after deployment of the vaccine in England only  but will work with the devolved administrations on their chosen approach  Administrations in Scotland  Wales and Northern Ireland will be responsible for the vaccine\\'s distribution in their relevant nations \\nCurrently  the UK government has placed orders for 100 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine  40 million doses of the vaccine from Pfizer and BioNTech and five million doses from US firm Moderna \\nRolling out the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine may pose the greatest challenge as it needs to be stored at minus 70C  raising potential difficulties with transport and storage  Who is Nadhim Zahawi  Nadhim Zahawi moved to the UK from Iraq with his family when he was nine years old In 2000 he co founded online market research agency YouGov and was its chief executive until he was selected as a Conservative parliamentary candidate in 2010 He was first elected as Conservative MP for Stratford on Avon in May 2010 In 2011 he co authored a book with fellow MP Matt Hancock  now the health secretary  on the human behaviour behind the banking crash   called \"Masters of Nothing\" In 2018 he became an education minister in Theresa May\\'s government  Under Boris Johnson\\'s premiership he was appointed as a business minister He is married and has three children\\nLast week  the government asked the regulator to assess the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine  marking \"a significant first step\" in getting the vaccine \"approved for deployment\" \\nIt follows a similar referral to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  MHRA  earlier this month to assess the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine  which has been shown to stop more than 90% of people developing Covid 19 symptoms in preliminary trials \\nOn Saturday  the Financial Times reported that regulatory approval for that vaccine could come as early as next week   and suggested rollout would start within hours of authorisation \\nInterim data from the trials of the Oxford jab showed an overall efficacy of 70%  The findings from one group of volunteers showed 62% efficacy while another group  who were given a different dose by accident  showed 90% efficacy \\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said the UK would be one of the first countries in the world to receive the vaccine  if it is authorised  with AstraZeneca set to have as many as four million doses ready for the UK by the end of the year and 40 million by the end of March 2021  Analysis\\nBy Ellie Price  political reporter  BBC News\\nIn ministerial terms  it\\'s a sideways move \\nBut Nadhim Zahawi\\'s new job comes with huge public expectation  and therefore the potential for political disaster \\nThe government is only too aware of the bloody nose it has received as a result of the shortcomings of NHS Test and Trace programme and the procurement of PPE at the start of the pandemic \\nGovernment scientists have said  if proven to be safe and effective  mass vaccinations will offer a \"much better horizon\" by the spring \\nHospitals and other NHS trusts in England say they have been told to get ready to administer jabs from the middle of December  The winter flu vaccine programme will offer some framework for how that will work in practice \\nMr Zahawi is seen as a good media performer  He has a business background and helped to set up the polling group YouGov  He\\'ll understand only too well the delicate art of keeping public opinion on side \\nMr Zahawi\\'s appointment follows calls from Labour for the government to appoint a vaccine minister  who would provide accountability and avoid repeating mistakes made over PPE procurement and NHS Test and Trace \\nShadow health secretary John Ashworth said  \"Only days ago Labour called for a vaccines minister to oversee the huge logistical challenge of widespread vaccination \\n\"We now need a mass public health campaign urging uptake of the vaccine  alongside ensuring the resources are in place for GPs and other health professionals to rapidly roll this out as soon as possible  Tier three \\'disappointment\\'\\nIn addition to the vaccine rollout  the prime minister has said mass community testing  as seen in Liverpool  will be offered to all areas in tier three after lockdown ends on 2 December \\nEarlier this week  Mr Zahawi tweeted that he was \"extremely disappointed and sad\" that Warwickshire  the county in which his constituency lies  would be placed in the most restricted tier   tier three   after England\\'s national lockdown ends next week \\nHe said he would be pushing for the county of Warwickshire to be considered separately from Coventry and Solihull in all future decisions about restrictions and for the rollout of mass testing   but urged residents \"to continue following the rules to the letter\" in the meantime \\nCovid  Your coronavirus pandemic in Wales questions answered\\nOver the past week  BBC Wales has asked readers to submit their questions about the coronavirus pandemic in Wales \\nWe asked if there was anything you wanted to know and whether the rules are confusing you   and pledged to try and answer \\nHere\\'s what you wanted to know \\n\"The death rate states that it includes all people that test positive in the last month but how many have actually died directly from Covid \" People die with coronavirus  not of coronavirus   just as people die with cancer  not of cancer \\nThat is because the actual cause of death is the effect the virus   or cancer   has on the body \\nFor example  Covid 19 can cause a huge degree of inflammation which becomes multi organ failure and this is the cause of death \\nSimilarly some cancers can  for example  damage blood vessels which causes bleeding in the brain   a stroke   which can be fatal \\nTherefore the damage to the body which causes death has been caused by coronavirus  but coronavirus is not the direct cause of death   the cause of death in this example would be organ failure \\nSo the deaths are with  not of  coronavirus \\nIn recording deaths with Covid 19  medical professionals will consider  \"Would this person be alive today if they had not caught coronavirus \"\\nIt has been estimated by the Office for National Statistics  ONS  that 88 9% of deaths in Wales where doctors have mentioned Covid 19 on the death certificate  that it was the underlying cause of death \\nSo in October  236 deaths were due to Covid 19  But there were another 49 when Covid 19 was involved and mentioned on the death certificate  and a factor in the death \\nIn Wales  Covid 19 was the underlying cause of death in 2 629 of deaths registered up to 7 November \\nIt is important to note the figures released daily by Public Health Wales or weekly by the ONS do not include all people who have tested positive in 28 days \\nRather  they include people who have had confirmed or suspected coronavirus within the past 28 days which is believed to have been a factor in their death  \"Is there any reason I should catch Covid if my extended household all work from home  rarely go out  are careful and play by all the rules \"\\nTaking safety measures such as working from home  staying home as much as possible and respecting the rules will put you in the best position to avoid the virus \\nHowever  anyone can catch coronavirus and anyone can pass it on \\nIt only takes one interaction with someone who may not even realise they are infected to potentially catch coronavirus \\nWhile coronavirus is mostly transmitted when people cough  sneeze or talk  there are also some studies showing it can be transmitted by touching an infected surface   such as on groceries or packages delivered to your home \\nThese studies have mostly been done in lab conditions and some experts have thrown doubt on the actual threat posed by surface transmission in real life \\nEither way   to best protect yourself from catching coronavirus from surfaces  regularly wash your hands for 20 seconds  \"If there is a wide uptake of vaccination would all of the basic measures such as masks and social distancing still apply \"\\nIf and when a vaccine  or more than one vaccine  is approved for use in the UK and begins to be rolled out  safety measures such as those you\\'ve listed will still need to be in place for some time \\nThat\\'s because it will take months to vaccinate everyone who wishes to be vaccinated \\nAs you\\'ve correctly implied  there are still questions over whether uptake of the vaccine will be high due to misinformation and myths on social media  and there may be some people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons \\nWe have fact checked some of the most widely shared false claims \\nEven if the uptake is good  we are likely to be well into 2021 before all the relevant groups have been offered the vaccination   which will probably begin with front line NHS staff and care staff  followed by the elderly and others most vulnerable to the virus \\nSo we\\'ll need to continue taking safety measures for the time being \\nIt is early days  but it\\'s likely the Welsh Government will continue to look at infection rates the way they have been doing since the beginning of the pandemic  and allow these measures to be dropped when scientific advisers believe it is safe to do so  \"Why has the country been \\'shut down\\' when out of a population of more than three million  about 3 000 people have died \"\\nIt has been recognised throughout the pandemic that Welsh people have made sacrifices and continue to make sacrifices   and Mark Drakeford has repeated during news briefings that every death is a tragedy \\nIn making decisions over lockdown measures  the Welsh Government looks at several factors including the R number   the average number of people a sick person could pass the virus on to \\nThe aim of lockdowns is to reduce the R number below one  which means case numbers would begin to fall   therefore fewer people are getting ill  leading to fewer hospital admissions so the NHS does not become overwhelmed  and fewer deaths \\nLockdown restrictions since March  along with social distancing and other safety measures  have served to shrink the R number \\nHowever  as the country has moved out of lockdowns  the R number has risen again \\nIn September  a \"reasonable worst case scenario\" for this winter was published by Swansea University experts  mentioning 636 000 infections  leading to 18 200 hospital admissions   peaking in January   and potentially 6 300 deaths \\nIf the NHS becomes overwhelmed  this does not just affect Covid patients but it restricts the organisation in how well other services such as cancer referrals and A&E can operate  \"What will be the long term health risks based on the delays to planned operations and cancer treatments \"\\nIt is expected to take years before NHS waiting times are back to pre coronavirus levels in Wales  according to the organisation\\'s boss \\nThe number of people waiting more than 36 weeks for planned hospital treatments is six times higher than at the start of 2020 \\nWaiting list figures  published in November for the first time since March  showed nearly 169 000 people waiting \\nThe number has grown after most non urgent treatment was postponed to prepare the NHS for the first coronavirus wave \\nSince then  the service has been trying to restart non emergency treatments and aims to keep them going as much as possible during the second wave \\nThe fear  of course  is that people who have missed out on early intervention as a result will have missed an opportunity for early treatment   such as in the case of Simon Green whose scan was delayed and brain tumour subsequently found to be inoperable \\nAs a result of such delays  Prof Tom Crosby of the Wales Cancer Network said as many as 2 000 people could die \\nThe Welsh Government said work was under way to address the issue with health boards \\nBut there are fears had such measures not been taken to reduce pressures on the NHS  the organisation could have been overwhelmed   which would also result in deaths  Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A  What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean  \\'I want to know how my dad got coronavirus\\' How will I get a coronavirus vaccine \\n\"Not acting would have meant that not only would the health service have been overwhelmed with very poor care of Covid and non Covid patients  but it also would have been disastrous for our staff \" Vaughan Gething said  \"Why do we use anti bacterial hand sanitisers when Covid 19 is a virus \"\\nBacterial infections and viruses are different and  for example  antibiotics only work on bacterial infections and not viruses \\nHowever  anti bacterial hand sanitisers or cleaning products can also be effective on some viruses if the alcohol concentration is high enough \\nViruses similar to the structure of coronavirus are sensitive to alcohol and detergents  which can help break down their oily  fatty shells \\nHand washing with soap is still the best cleaning practice  according to the NHS  \"I would like to know if there is any evidence to demonstrate where most transmissions are occurring  eg between houses  shops  pubs  school \"\\nThis data is not routinely released  and there could be data protection issues if it were  But local authorities and the Welsh Government have occasionally referenced why lockdown measures have needed to be tightened in certain areas \\nFor example  schools in Cardigan have closed for two weeks after a spike in cases in the area  with Ceredigion council leader Ellen ap Gwynn blaming \"super spreader events\" such as \"parties\" and \"pub crawls\" \\nWhen parts of the south Wales valleys were placed under stricter lockdown measures  transmissions were believed to have been occurring due to people going into each others\\' homes and not adhering to social distancing \\nAnd measures have been taken in hospitals and care homes when there is evidence of transmission there \\nSo while this data is not routinely made available to the public  when it leads to specific decisions on restrictions  an explanation is usually given  \"Has or did the Welsh firebreak have any effect in bringing down cases in Wales \"\\nWhile it takes a few weeks or even longer to fully understand the impact any change in restrictions has made  there are promising early signs the firebreak has helped  the Welsh Government says \\nThe chief medical officer\\'s analysis said the evidence was now \"good enough\" that it did \"succeed\" \\nMark Drakeford said the amount of people with coronavirus in hospital was \"stabilising\" \\n\"What we need to see is incidence in the community falling and that translating into falling numbers of people in hospital or needing critical care \" he added \\n\"We\\'re seeing the first signs of the growth of people in hospital beds reducing and bed numbers stabilising \\n\"What we have to do is build on that and make sure we don\\'t fritter all that away by going back to the behaving in ways that will drive those numbers back up again \"\\nPlaid Cymru said the Welsh Government should be taking steps to ensure there was no need for another national lockdown  \"With the end of the lockdown in England  can I travel to England \"\\nYes   to some areas \\nTravel in and out of Wales from England was previously banned unless you had a valid and essential reason  but Welsh Government rules updated on 3 December have changed this \\nFrom 18 00 GMT on Friday  travel is only banned between Wales and tier 3 areas of England and tier 3 and 4 areas of Scotland and Northern Ireland \\nThis means you are now able to travel to and from tier 1 and 2 areas   replacing the previous blanket travel ban   although the government strongly advises against travelling to those areas at all \\nHere\\'s how to find out which tier an area of England is in \\nBetween 23 and 27 December  you can travel anywhere in the UK to form your Christmas bubble  \"Many people suffered last Christmas with Covid symptoms  Is it possible we have had it \"\\nThere were calls earlier this year for a spike in excess deaths in January and February in Ceredigion to be investigated \\nIn the first 17 weeks of the year 342 deaths were registered in Ceredigion  according to figures obtained by Newyddion S4C   22% more than the five year average \\nMP Ben Lake wanted to know if Covid 19 was present before it was realised \\nCardiff University\\'s Rhian Daniel said this was not \"highly likely\" and was likely due to a similar infection \\nHowever  due to antibodies potentially fading to undetectable levels a few months after infection  taking an antibody test now probably wouldn\\'t identify whether that virus you had last winter really was Covid 19 or another virus causing similar symptoms \\nScientists and doctors in some European countries have claimed to have found evidence of coronavirus circulating earlier than previously thought \\nAnd with evidence of coronavirus arriving in the UK on at least 1 300 separate occasions  we may never know exactly when the UK saw its patient zero  \"Why do some people get mild symptoms and others are struggling months later \"\\nLong Covid has now been recognised as a medical condition  and healthcare workers are receiving guidance on it \\nThere is no medical definition or list of symptoms shared by all patients   two people with long Covid can have very different experiences \\nHowever  the most common feature is crippling fatigue \\nOthers symptoms include  breathlessness  a cough that won\\'t go away  joint pain  muscle aches  hearing and eyesight problems  headaches  loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart  lungs  kidneys and gut \\nMental health problems have been reported including depression  anxiety and struggling to think clearly \\nIt can utterly destroy people\\'s quality of

clinician\\'s \"subjective view of a person\\'s quality of life\" \\nBut despite reminding care providers of their obligations  the CQC said it received evidence from staff and patients\\' families that DNARs had been applied without consultation \\nThe number of complaints it received about the orders jumped to 40 between March and September  compared to just nine similar complaints in the previous six months \\nOne carer told the CQC an on call doctor had informed care home staff that if a resident were to catch Covid 19  a DNAR would automatically be put in place \\nAnother witness said some care homes and learning disability services had been told by GPs to place blanket orders on everyone in their care \\nSome families of patients said they were not made aware such an order was in place until their relative was quite unwell \\nOthers said they had been told their loved one had agreed to a DNAR  but they had concerns over their understanding due to factors such as a lack of English or deafness  \\'Blanket approach\\'\\nThe CQC also found examples of routine care not being provided in homes  such as an ambulance or doctor not being called  due to the existence of the do not resuscitate order \\nInappropriate DNARs may still be on people\\'s files  the CQC said \\nRosie Benneyworth  chief inspector of primary medical services and integrated care at the CQC  said  \"It is unacceptable for clinical decisions   decisions which could dictate whether someone\\'s loved one gets the right care when they need it most   to be applied in a blanket approach to any group of people \"\\nAn NHS spokeswoman said  \"The NHS has repeatedly instructed local clinicians that the blanket application of DNARs would be totally unacceptable and that access to treatment and care

Blaenau Gwent \\nIt has the fastest case rise in Wales   307 7 per 100 000 up to 26 September   215 actual cases  over a seven day period \\nEarlier analysis by the BBC suggested it was also the hardest hit area in the UK for the week up to 25 September \\nBut the most recent figures out on Tuesday saw Burnley in Lancashire overtake Blaenau Gwent  on 314 cases per 100 000 \\nThe areas hardest hit for infection rate rises in recent weeks have been in the north of England \\nBlaenau Gwent also had the highest rate of positive tests in Wales   10 4% in the past week  Any figure above 4% is worrying for health officials \\nA cluster of cases in the Brynmawr area in particular has been causing concern and a mobile testing unit was set up last week in Nantyglo \\nMererid Bowley  interim public health director at Aneurin Bevan health board  said she hoped it would \"help us learn more about the rate of infection  help us protect the residents of Blaenau Gwent\" \\nCounciI leader Nigel Daniels also urged residents to \"do what\\'s needed\" and \"help to fight off any second wave of this dreadful virus in Wales\"  How are businesses coping \\nDarren Brice  landlord of The Castle in Tredegar  said just two people were in the pub on a Tuesday lunchtime and any further restrictions would be \"devastating\" for all pubs in the town \\n\"For some of them there\\'s been no coming back \" he said  \"We seem to be the ones getting the blame \\n\"When you go to supermarkets  with thousands of people through their door every day  no track and trace  picking up items  I think it\\'s very unfair the hospitality trade has been singled out \"\\nMichael James has owned a hair salon in the town for 37 years but said the past couple of weeks had seen business go \"very quiet\" \\nHe added  \"People are scared to come out  We\\'re hanging in there  Tredegar wasn\\'t exactly booming before all this happened  \\n\"Most valleys towns are the same  I think a number of shops would be closing if this went on until March   half the town might go \" How are other areas affected by covid \\nBlaenau Gwent has overtaken another heads of the valleys area Merthyr Tydfil   which still has more than 217 positive tests per 100 000 and was also ranked seventh hardest hit UK area \\nThese two local authorities are among 11 local areas  along with Llanelli town  which have been put into local lockdown \\nCaerphilly now has one of the biggest falling case rates  lying at 50 8 cases per 100 000 in the most recent week  lower than the Welsh average and ranking 96th in the UK  Figuring out the stats about Covid 19 in Wales Tackling coronavirus \\'down to every one of us\\' Wales\\' local coronavirus lockdowns  What are the rules \\nThere are also \"areas of concern\" in other areas  which has led to four north Wales council areas also facing restrictions from Thursday \\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford earlier met council leaders to discuss coronavirus cases in the region \\nThe worries were over rising rates in Conwy  Denbighshire  Flintshire  and Wrexham\\nIt comes as the so called R number   an estimate of the infection rate in Wales   has risen \\nThis measures the average number a sick person could pass the virus on to   so anything above one means it is spreading \\nThe R rate is now between 1 0 and 1 4 in Wales  however the true figure is expected to be higher  according to the Welsh Government\\'s scientific expert group  the Technical Advisory Cell \\nPreviously it was estimated at being between 0 7 and 1 2  with Mr Drakeford saying officials were \"confident it is above one\" \\nMeanwhile  the latest ONS weekly mortality figures show the total number of covid deaths in the pandemic in Wales up to 18 September was 2 575 \\nCardiff has had the largest number of deaths with 389  followed by Rhondda Cynon Taf with 303 up to 18 September but the rate of increase has dramatically slowed down in recent months \\nSo called excess deaths  which compare all registered deaths with previous years  are fewer than the five year average for the most recent week \\nLooking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing \\nIn Wales  the number of deaths fell to 555 in the latest week  20 fewer than the 2015 19 average \\nCovid  Tackling coronavirus \\'down to every one of us\\'\\nOne of Wales\\'s most eminent doctors has said we are in \"a precarious position\" with almost two million people subject to new Covid restrictions \\nBaroness Ilora Finlay said people needed to take personal responsibility to stop the spread of the virus \\nShe told BBC Wales that without quick action the NHS would become \"completely overwhelmed\" \\nEleven of Wales\\' 22 council areas  including Cardiff and Swansea  are in local lockdown with tighter rules \\n\"I think that the Welsh Government have got a very difficult job \" said Baroness Finlay  who is a Bevan Commissioner  a member of a group of independent experts that provides advice on health and care in Wales \\n\"We have to get the message across to everybody in the population that they have personal responsibility for breaking the chain of transmission \" she said \\n\"It isn\\'t that the government can do it  it isn\\'t that some other body can do it   it\\'s down to each and every one of us \"\\nRestrictions mean no travel outside council boundaries other than for work  education or medical emergencies  with no indoor mixing allowed and no alcohol sales after 22 00 \\n\"This isn\\'t about breaking rules \" said Baroness Finlay  Has Covid 19 changed the way we talk about death  My neighbours are breaking the rules   what should I say \\n\"This is about caring about the people who you love  who matter to you and realising that if you take that virus home  or you give it to somebody who you\\'re fond of and love  and they are desperately sick  you live with that guilt for the rest of your life \\n\"This isn\\'t transient  People who are bereaved will live with this for the rest of their lives \"\\nBlaenau Gwent now has the highest rate of infection in Wales   with 305 positive tests per 100 000 people   and is among the areas in local lockdown \\nHowever  council chairwoman Amanda Moore said some people were still ignoring guidelines while others believed the virus was a \"hoax\" \\n\"We have a small number of people who are carrying on as normal and ignore the advice \" she told BBC Radio Wales \\n\"I\\'m hearing people say  \\'why should I social distance  I haven\\'t got it\\'  Some people still believe the virus is a hoax  It\\'s really unbelievable what people are thinking \\n\"It\\'s the ones with the mindset that it does not affect them  No matter what rules are put in place  there\\'ll be people who will break them \"\\nBaroness Finlay also said testing was \"not a panacea\" and following rules around social distancing and hand washing were more important \\n\"I think that the problem with the message around testing is that bizarrely it can give you a false sense of security \\n\"People think if they\\'ve got a negative test  they\\'re okay  It doesn\\'t mean that \\n\"A negative test maybe means that you\\'re at the beginning and you\\'re just not producing enough virus for it to be picked up yet \\n\"Testing does not give you a free pass \" she said \\nBaroness Finlay said she was concerned NHS staff were \"exhausted\" after responding to the first wave of the pandemic \\n\"It isn\\'t about paying them all  or going out and clapping  or whatever  It\\'s about recognising that we must do all we can to flatten that curve  to not have that pressure \" she said \\nHer comments were echoed by an intensive care consultant who warned it could only take a few people\\'s \"bad behaviour\" to \"cripple\" the NHS \\nDr Ami Jones of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said  \"Please do what you can to obey the rules because the NHS cannot cope with another big wave of covid  plus the usual winter pressures \\n\"It\\'s very simple things   it\\'s not going into people\\'s houses  wearing face masks  washing your hands and having flu jabs \\n\"A few people\\'s bad behaviour could absolutely cripple the NHS this year  Please don\\'t be one of those people \"\\nAs one of Wales\\' leading end of life care specialists  Baroness Finlay is calling for health organisations not to impose a blanket ban on families visiting due to coronavirus restrictions going forward \\nDuring the peak it was not uncommon for next of kin be prevented from spending their final hours with their loved ones \\n\"I think we need to have a much more nuanced  gentle  compassionate approach to how we manage people who are dying and those who love them \" she said \\n\"They want to be with them [at the end]  they want to sit with them  of course they do \\n\"And I worry that we may have got the balance wrong and we need to get it right \"\\nCoronavirus  Test for Covid 19 T cells immunity developed\\nA company in Cardiff has developed a test for coronavirus T cells   which can potentially provide longer term immunity to the virus than antibodies \\nThe body develops T cells when fighting an infection and they can help create more antibodies if a person is exposed again \\nThis means the immune system could remember how to fight Covid 19 even after original antibodies have faded \\nIndoor Biotechnologies is \"hopeful\" the test will help in vaccine development \\nIt has received almost £50 000 in funding from Innovate UK  a research scheme supported by the UK Government \\nThe company\\'s trials found some people who had coronavirus but tested negative for antibodies went on to test positive for T cells   meaning more people may have some immunity than previously thought   and for longer \\nIt is working with Cardiff University\\'s School of Medicine on the test and is now approaching vaccine developers  pharmaceutical companies and public health bodies with the product \\nDr James Hindley  executive director of Indoor Biotechnologies and leading the T cell project  said  \"A lot of the focus so far as been on antibodies and that\\'s important because they provide us some memory to our immune system  but T cells are just as important \"\\nHe said the company had been testing hundreds of people who tested positive for coronavirus in the past   with a focus on healthcare workers   to check whether they had developed T cells \\nIt has also tested people who have never had coronavirus  to ensure its accuracy \\nSome T cells help another cell type   B cells   to create antibodies if a person is exposed to the virus again  while others can fight the virus directly themselves  How long do T cells last \\nDr Hindley  whose PhD was in T cells  said  \"They can live for a long time after the infection and give you that immune response \\n\"We don\\'t know with this virus how long they will last  but it might be for many years \\n\"That\\'s the basis of vaccination and vaccination development \\n\"We have found some situations where people have tested negative for antibodies and positive for T cells  but the significance of that we can only really determine with longer term studies \"\\nCurrently only a handful of laboratories across the world are equipped to test for T cells  and it is a \"laborious\" process with a lot of complex machinery  Dr Hindley said \\nHis test has \"stripped back everything to the bare bones\" so the test can be performed by any lab with a single vial of blood  with results within 24 hours \\nThe focus of the company\\'s efforts are how the test can help with vaccine development  but Dr Hindley said it could eventually be rolled out to the public as a more sensitive method of testing for immunity \\n\"It is something the general public could find useful \" he said \\nDr Ian Campbell  executive chair at Innovate UK which is supporting the project with funding  said  \"This will give clinicians an extra tool  in addition to antibody tests  as we seek to develop treatments and vaccines \"\\nDr Martin Scurr  a post doctorate researcher in Cardiff\\'s School of Medicine  is working with Indoor Biotechnologies on the test \\n\"The aim is to develop a T cell test that can be easily used by labs across the world  enabling mass testing of Covid 19 T cell immunity to be performed \" he said \\nCovid 19  Facebook to take down false vaccine claims\\nFacebook says it will start removing false claims about Covid 19 vaccines to prevent \"imminent physical harm\" \\nThe company says it is accelerating its plans to ban misleading and false information on its Facebook and Instagram platforms following the announcement of the first vaccine being approved for use in the United Kingdom \\nAmong already debunked claims that won\\'t be allowed are falsehoods about vaccine ingredients  safety  effectiveness and side effects \\nAlso banned will be the long running false conspiracy theory that coronavirus vaccines will contain a microchip to control or monitor patients \\nFacebook has come under fire for what\\'s been seen as a patchy approach to fake news and false claims  and misleading content about the pandemic is still widely available on its platforms \\nWhat did Facebook say \\nIt says it will remove false claims about Covid 19 vaccines \"that have already been debunked by public health experts\" \\nFacebook says that since January it has been removing content about the pandemic  such as false cures and treatments or claims that the disease doesn\\'t exist at all \\nIn October  it banned advertisements that discouraged people from taking vaccines \\nThis is a continuation of the policy \"to remove misinformation about the virus that could lead to imminent physical harm\"  the company said \\n\"This could include false claims about the safety  efficacy  ingredients or side effects of the vaccines [and] false claims that Covid 19 vaccines contain microchips  or anything else that isn\\'t on the official vaccine ingredient list \\n\"We will also remove conspiracy theories about Covid 19 vaccines that we know today are false \"\\nHowever  Facebook warned that these policies  which the BBC understands have been brought forward following the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine by the British medicines regulator  will take some time to come into effect \\n\"We will not be able to start enforcing these policies overnight \" a Facebook statement said \\nSocial media is awash with conspiracy theories about coronavirus vaccines  which resurface whenever news breaks   like the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for use in the UK \\nThese conspiracies are worlds away from legitimate concerns  making false allegations of microchipping  genocide and DNA alternation \\nFor that reason  many will welcome the announcement of this crackdown by Facebook   including politicians who have been calling for action from the social media giants \\nIt\\'s tougher than previous announcements   this time a commitment to removing conspiracies rather than just fact checking or labelling these posts as misleading \\nBut fears remain that yet another commitment to tackle misinformation by the social media site will not translate into effective action   or be the right approach \\nConspiracy narratives about the coronavirus vaccine have become so prevalent  often originating in anti vaccination and pseudoscience circles before spilling into parent chats  community forums and Instagram feeds \\nUndoing those narratives months after they first began to spread may not be enough to reverse the seeds of doubt they have sown in communities around the world \\nCovid in Wales  How many deaths have there been \\nA further 28 people have died with coronavirus in Wales  taking the total to 2 474  according to the latest figures \\nPublic Health Wales data also showed 1 251 more people had tested positive for Covid 19  taking the total to 75 986 \\nEach of Wales\\' seven health boards reported at least one new Covid related death on Thursday \\nCwm Taf Morgannwg reported the highest number  with eight new deaths \\nAcross other health boards in Wales  Swansea Bay reported seven new deaths  while there were six in Aneurin Bevan

Neath Port Talbot  294 5  \\nGwynedd  23 1  and Conwy  28 2  have the lowest case rates in the country \\nThere has now been a total of 1 441 357 tests carried out in Wales since the start of the pandemic  with 14 564 carried out on Wednesday \\nWhy are deaths lower in Powys \\nAcute patients from Powys are usually treated across the border at hospitals in England  so deaths of Powys residents usually only appear in registrations reported later by the Office for National Statistics  ONS  \\nThose ONS figures   which are higher   also count both confirmed and suspected cases of Covid  as well as deaths in all settings  including care homes  hospices and people\\'s own homes  The most recent weekly figures are the highest since May \\nPHW reports new deaths daily  but these are usually from previous days \\nCovid 19  Cwm Taf Morgannwg has most hospital patients\\nCwm Taf Morgannwg health board has more patients being treated for Covid 19 than at any time since the pandemic began

Wales with 49% more patients with the virus than a week before \\nFigures also show Aneurin Bevan health board has most hospital admissions \\nThe area  covering Newport  Monmouthshire  Caerphilly  Torfaen  Blaenau Gwent and parts of south Powys  saw an average of 28 patients being admitted with suspected or confirmed Covid 19 symptoms each day over the past week \\nThis is more than twice the numbers in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Cardiff and Vale areas \\nThe numbers for Cwm Taf Morgannwg admissions reflect Covid 19 infection outbreaks in three of its main hospitals  with 205 cases linked to the outbreak  including patients \\nAnother 20 cases are being monitored at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda \\nThe health board said earlier this week there had been 47 deaths  38 at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant  five at Prince Charles in Merthyr Tydfil  and four at the Princess of Wales in Bridgend \\nFrom Thursday  its Bridgend Seren hospital opened to its first patients \"well on the road to recovery\" to allow its three district hospitals to focus on acute care in those locations \\nIt comes as most elective surgery is postponed at the Royal Glamorgan \\nThe board\\'s Medical Director Dr Nick Lyons said  \"Ysbyty\\'r Seren will provide a breadth of care for these patients  which will include support with their emotional and physical wellbeing as they recover from the virus \\n\"The safety of our patients and staff remains our first priority and we now seeing the very beginnings of the positive impact of the mitigating actions we are taking across our sites to contain the spread of the virus \"\\nThe figures show \\nThere were 707 coronavirus related patients in hospital beds in Wales   49 5% more than the week before  This is about half of the number at the peak  1 347 patients \\nOf those  326 were confirmed Covid 19 patients   the highest figure since early June  There were 284 patients with suspected Covid and 97 who were recovering from the virus A total of 25 people were being treated on invasive ventilated beds  including in critical care  for confirmed or suspected coronavirus  according to the figures on 13 October   three fewer than the week before  although NHS Wales said it expected this figure to rise Both the Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan boards  two of the main \"hotspot\" areas for infections over recent weeks  had six patients each  and another six were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board The seven day average in total daily admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid 19 cases continues to rise and is currently 84  up six on the previous week and the highest since June\\nOf those 326 confirmed Covid 19 cases in Welsh hospitals  more than half of patients are in Cwm Taf Morgannwg \\nWith the Aneurin Bevan health board  it is comfortably above other health boards for the number of Covid patients  confirmed  suspected and recovering from the virus \\nAndrew Goodall  NHS Wales\\' chief executive  said demand for beds would continue to increase in the days and weeks ahead \\nHe said it was a virus that \"surprises us with its ability  particularly in closed settings  in its ability to transmit

now started to slow down in Thanet and Swale \\nBoth authorities will be hoping mass rapid testing that has been promised to all areas in tier three will play a part in bringing down the spread of infection  much like it\\'s believed to have done in Liverpool \\nEveryone will be keeping a close eye on those numbers when the restrictions are reviewed on the 16 December \\nTory MPs in Kent had

based intensive care consultant Dr Jack Parry Jones said although only about 10% of patients in critical care he came across at the moment had Covid 19  it was still affecting how care was delivered to other patients  like those receiving trauma  cardiac or cancer treatment \\n\"As opposed to the first wave  the patients I\\'m seeing are coming in more slowly but the concern is that it will start escalating rapidly as the number of cases in the community increases \" said Dr Parry Jones  a board member of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine \\n\"We have too few critical care beds and staff

added  \"Just because the two week lockdown is over we shouldn\\'t be complacent  we should be on our guard and follow restrictions \"\\nMr Davies also felt the Welsh Government\\'s new restrictions

common approach to Christmas\" \\nMr Drakeford also welcomed new findings from trials of a potential coronavirus vaccine  but cautioned it was unlikely to represent \"a magic bullet\" that means coronavirus is about to \"disappear out of our lives\" \\nWhat are the new Wales wide regulations \\nDuring the firebreak some supermarket aisles selling non essential items were closed off\\nThe new regulations made by the Welsh ministers cover everything from seeing friends and family to travel and visiting pubs and restaurants \\nThey impose limits on meeting other people  prohibit people from entering or leaving Wales without a reasonable excuse  impose requirements on people who have tested positive for coronavirus  and contain rules for public facing business and services \\nTwo families

the first time since March  show nearly 169 000 people waiting \\nThe total waiting list has now swelled by more than 55 500 \\nThe number has grown after most non urgent treatment was postponed to prepare the NHS for the first coronavirus wave \\nSince then  the service has been trying to restart non emergency treatments and aims to keep them going as much as possible during the second wave \\nDespite recent progress  NHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall warned waiting times could grow even further  saying there was a \"real concern\" that hospital doctors were only able to see about half as many in patients and day cases as normal \\nHe believes there will be a third fewer out patients seen and operating theatres working at half their usual capacity due to infection control measures \\nData showed that between March and August there had been a five fold increase in the longest waiting times of more than 36 weeks \\n\"The overall waiting list has not changed so much  it\\'s simply patients have been shifted more to the end of the list as we\\'ve had to prioritise urgent and emergency cases \" Dr Goodall added \\n\"We have made a lot of improvement on waiting times

many \\nWelsh Government targets state 95% of patients should be treated within six months and nobody should wait longer than six months \\nRecent analysis by the BBC Wales Investigates programme suggested at least 49 000 people in Wales were waiting more than a year in September and for six out of seven health boards  at least 25 000 were waiting for surgery \\nThat would amount to a tenfold increase in the number of patients compared to September 2019 \\nThe Welsh Government said \"difficult decisions\" were made to postpone surgery and outcomes for patients would have been even worse

for Unscheduled Care\\nDr Jo Mower  clinical director for the National Programme for Unscheduled Care  has been a consultant in Cardiff for the past 16 years \\nShe said she was confident the new measures  alongside the current time targets  would be better for those who came to A&E themselves  as well as those who arrive by ambulance \\n\"There may be times when we\\'re overwhelmed  but we want to ensure our patients are triaged and assessed as close to their arrival time as possible  so the patient can get the right treatment  especially for those critical interventions like heart attacks  sepsis  strokes   and this will identify those patients but also those who could possibly wait a little longer for their treatment \"\\nThe current target is 95% of patients should spend no longer than four hours in A&E  but this has never been met since it was introduced in 2010 \\nThe waiting times for A&E for October showed 76 5% of patients were seen  transferred or discharged within four hours  a slight improvement on both January and about the same October 2019 \\nThere were 4 360 patients who waited more than 12 hours  even though the targets state nobody should have to wait that long \\nHowever  critics of the current measures say they give little indication of the quality and urgency of care given to patients \\nMeanwhile  in September  there was a 13 5% rise in patients entering the single cancer treatment pathway  compared to the month before  although this was still 1 145  8 7%  compared to a year before \\nFor the third month in a row  the Welsh Ambulance Service failed to meet its target of reaching 65% of \"red\" life threatening calls within eight minutes \\nIn October  60 8% arrived within eight minutes  Health officials said one issue is that it can take up to six minutes for staff to get into full PPE kit before seeing each patient  while a standard clean now for ambulances took up to 20 minutes after each call \\nDr Goodall said once the pandemic has been brought under control  the NHS would need to transform the way it works in order to tackle the backlog \\nBut he said the rapid changes made to deal with Covid 19   such as the growth in video consultations   proved what was possible  and he believed ministers would consider long term funding challenges \\n\\'Overwhelmed\\'\\n\"I personally feel our longest waiting times may still take a number of years to resolve  But what I don\\'t want to happen is we continue to respond in the same old fashioned way \"\\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said an extra £30m had been made available for the remainder of 2020/21 \\nBut he said the effects of Covid would be long lasting \\n\"The extraordinary figures today underscore the nature of the challenge that our NHS faces and the very direct impact of responding to this unfinished pandemic \" he said \\n\"If we\\'d tried to run our services as normal I am confident we\\'d have been overwhelmed  but not allowing this to happen means we\\'ve built up a significant backlog which means it\\'ll take pretty much a full Senedd term to resolve  It\\'s important that people understand the reality of where we are \"\\nHe added  \"That will mean more challenges for people who are waiting longer and it\\'ll mean significant challenges for our NHS  because our staff are still in the midst of coping with the pandemic  so there are big and difficult choices ahead that will go well beyond when this pandemic finally does come to an end \"\\nWhat has the reaction been \\nThe British Medical Association  BMA  in Wales said the figures had reached extraordinary levels and were \"stark\" \\n\"What is vital now  is clear messaging for these patients  many of whom have  and continue to suffer due to these delays \" said David Bailey  chair of the BMA council in Wales \\n\"Clear communication which provides insight as to where they are in the system  may offer a small amount of peace of mind  To have no information at all will be for many  extremely distressing \"\\nResponding to the A&E waiting time figures  Dr Suresh Pillai  of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Wales said it showed a worrying trend of increasing long waits \\n\"Long waits have always been dangerous  but at a time where Covid is still endemic and we are having to care for patients alongside managing the virus  we simply cannot have crowded emergency departments \" he said \\nDr Olwen Williams  of the Royal College of Physicians in Wales  said Dr Goodall\\'s comments reflected the views of many doctors on the frontline \\n\"We

Kuenssberg\\nPolitical editor\\n@bbclaurak\\non Twitter\\nPublished\\n9 September\\nShare\\nRelated Topics\\nCoronavirus pandemic\\nPA MEDIA\\nThere is more than one \"rule of six\"  Who knew \\nIt\\'s what a legendary Hollywood film editor used to describe the best of way making a must watch movie  mixing six different elements like emotion and space  his name is Walter Murch  if you are on the hunt for trivia  \\nThe other rule of six is part of the code that rules corporate takeovers  more familiar to City lawyers  You may indeed have your own obscure examples \\nBut ministers hope now the government\\'s new rule of six will very quickly become familiar to the country and will immediately change people\\'s behaviour too \\n\\'We must act\\' to prevent second lockdown  says PM\\nWhat are the new rules for meeting my friends \\nHow many confirmed cases are there in your area \\nFrom Monday  it will be illegal in England  apart from at school or work or under other few exceptions  to meet more than five other people at a time \\nThe police will have the power to stop that happening   you can read exactly how the new restrictions will work here \\nAfter weeks when the government has been trying to cheerlead the country back to the office  urging pupils back to school and taking steps to roll back coronavirus restrictions it is quite the change of tone  change of pace  and change of heart \\nThe prime minister also acknowledged publicly  after many weeks of questions about the layers of anomalies and different rules and regulations  that complicated messages had made the rules hard for people to follow \\nTHE R NUMBER  What it means and why it matters\\nSUPPORT BUBBLES  What are they and who can be in yours \\nTEST AND TRACE  How does it work \\nSCHOOLS  What will happen if children catch coronavirus \\nTESTING  What tests are available \\nBoris Johnson can hope that the public in England will be willing to follow a new  clearer instruction  But it is not obvious that the public will all comply \\nThe reason for the change however  as we discussed yesterday  is crystal clear \\nThe number of cases has started to rise  and rise quickly  and ministers want to slam on the brakes \\nThe new rule is a significant move  and it\\'s plain it could mean limits on our lives for many months  The prime minister today acknowledged that even Christmas may not be much like normal \\nThe changes are designed to prevent the disease taking off again  and to stop the need for another full national lockdown  something the government is desperate to avoid \\nOpening hours\\nBut other measures are waiting in the wings too \\nAt the bottom of the government\\'s guidance issued today  there is a rather bland  technical sounding paragraph \\n\"The government will restrict the opening hours of premises  initially in local lockdown areas  with the option of national action in the future  This has been introduced in Bolton  following a steep rise in cases  and will seek to restrict activities that may lead to a spread in the virus \"\\nIn other words  if the rise in cases doesn\\'t slow  the government could bring in a national curfew on opening hours  a more radical step \\nGovernment sources emphasise this is not about to happen \\nBut by laying out the option  it\\'s clear the rule of six could be followed by more radical steps \\nCovid restrictions in London \\'increasingly likely\\'\\nLondon could face further restrictions to slow down the spread of the virus\\nMeasures to slow the spread of Covid 19 in London are becoming \"increasingly likely\"  its mayor has said \\nSadiq Khan made the announcement after holding an emergency meeting with London council leaders  the government and Public Health England \\nHe said he was extremely concerned by evidence of the accelerating speed with which coronavirus was spreading in the city \\nIt comes amid warnings of a \"second wave\" of the virus across the UK \\nMr Khan said the situation was being made worse by uncertainty over the lack of testing capacity in the capital \\n\\'We should not wait\\'\\nHe said  \"It is increasingly likely that  in London  additional measures will soon be required to slow the spread of the virus \\n\"We will be considering some of the measures which have already been imposed in other parts of the UK \\n\"I am of the firm view that we should not wait  as happened six months ago  for this virus to again spiral out of control before taking action \"\\nThe number of cases per 100 000 people over seven days is reported to have increased in London from 18 8 to about 25 \\nLondoners have been urged to be as cautious as possible over the weekend  by following social distancing rules  washing hands and wearing face coverings \\nThe mayor said the situation was being made worse by uncertainty over testing\\nMr Khan said  \"The best thing for both public health and the economy is new restrictions imposed early  rather than a full lockdown when it\\'s too late   but the government must urgently ensure there is a fully functioning testing system \"\\nThe sharp rise in UK cases over the last two weeks comes amid ongoing problems with the government\\'s test and trace programme  leading to people struggling to access tests \\nThe government says testing capacity   which it defines as how many can be processed in the lab each day   is higher than ever \\nCovid  Wedding cancelled as venue becomes vaccination centre\\nSimon Jones and Jenna Roberts said the second cancellation was \"ten times worse\"\\nA couple say they are \"heartbroken\" at having their wedding cancelled for a second time in six months by Covid 19 \\nJenna Roberts and Simon Jones were due to tie the knot in July but the wedding was cancelled due to lockdown \\nNow their \"dream\" has been shattered again after the venue at Margam Park  Port Talbot  was confirmed as a Covid 19 vaccination centre \\nThey want compensation from Neath Port Talbot  NPT   claiming they have been left £2 000 out of pocket \\nSimon and Jenna  from Porth  Rhonda Cynon Taff  had waited almost three years for their wedding at The Orangery  after booking in 2017  but said they understood the reasons for cancelling first time  during lockdown \\nThey postponed the special day to July next year  only to be informed on Friday it can no longer go ahead \\nThe venue is to be used as a vaccination centre for up to 12 months from 13 December \\nNPT council said the venue was \"absolutely necessary\" and would play a \"crucial role\" in the Covid 19 vaccination programme for local people \\nWhat will a coronavirus wedding look like \\n\\'Unknown\\' vaccine schedule for care home residents\\nQ&A  How will the vaccine rollout work in Wales \\nThe venue has cancelled 64 weddings  which can be rearranged for a later date in 2022 when the venue is due to reopen   or a full deposit offered \\n\"The worst part was I had to get off the phone and tell my partner we had to cancel our wedding again  She just burst into tears \" said Simon  38 \\n\"We\\'ve had no communication about this at all  so it just came out of the blue  Had we known  we wouldn\\'t have booked suppliers again \"\\nThe couple say they have to find another £2000 to make up for lost costs\\nJenna  34  said  \"The first time was hard enough  the second time was ten times worse  There were a lot of tears \\n\"We have elderly relatives that might not be able to make out wedding in two years time  It\\'s just terrible \"\\nWhile they are able to set a new date or get most of their deposit back  they will not get refunds for stationary  such as invites  the videographer and their children\\'s bridesmaids dresses and suits \\nSimon estimates the total cost to rearrange again will be about £2 000 \\n\"In no way do we blame them for any of this  but we are truly heartbroken and devastated at the fact Neath Port Talbot Council have had no thoughts on the implications it has caused by taking over a wedding venue \" he said \\nSimon and Jenna have one child together  alongside two Jenna has from a previous relationship \\nThe Margam Orangery is among 12 sites being used as a vaccination centre by NPT and Swansea councils  due to its size  location and available car parking \\nA NPT council spokesperson said it was aware of the disappointment but plan to deliver 500 vaccinations every day  seven days a week  to \"safeguard the health of local residents as quickly as possible\" \\nThe venue said continuing to hold weddings would have reduced the building\\'s capacity for vaccinating by 1 500 per wedding \\nCouncillor Peter Rees said  \"We sincerely apologise but the venue will play pivotal role in saving lives \\n\"We ask that couples and their families understand that we would not take this action unless it was absolutely necessary and in the interests of public safety \\n\"We will honour our 2020 prices for any of couples who chose an alternative date in 2022  and will offer them first refusal to move back to their original date  should the vaccination programme be completed earlier than next December \"\\nWhat is a Covid vaccination centre \\nOn Wednesday  the Pfizer vaccine was judged safe for use in UK next week  Preparations will be made for the rollout of the vaccine as early as next week \\nEach health board will get its share and vaccines will go across Wales at the same time  Mass vaccination centres will be set up   particularly for the mRNA vaccine  which needs to be stored at  70 degrees \\nOfficials say each site will have tight security and the vaccines will be guarded \"like a VIP\"  as well as cyber and IT security measures being taken \\nCovid Christmas  Are gift cards wise or wasteful \\nBlack Friday\\nAllen  a father of three from Salford  saved all year to buy gift cards for his daughters \\n\"They love nothing more than going out to the Boxing Day sales with their vouchers \" he says of the trio  aged 15  14 and 12 \\nThe problem is that the gift cards are for the Arcadia group   the embattled retailer that went into administration on Monday \\nGift card holders have now been told that they will only be valid for half of an order  So  to use their £100 card in full  each of the girls will need to spend £200 at one of Arcadia\\'s stores  such as Topshop \\n\"I\\'d have to spend an extra £300 to get the value  At Christmas time you don\\'t need the extra expense \" Allen says \\nOn the brink\\nHe describes the decision as \"unacceptable\"  Legally  it is a grey area  but administrators are not obliged to accept gift cards \\nThat has prompted questions over the suitability of gift cards for Christmas  at a time when retailers are finding it tough and some are on the brink \\nFurther questions were asked when a website glitch at Currys PC World wiped hundreds of pounds off gift cards and left Black Friday bargain hunters without their shopping \\nProviders say the fears are unfounded and that buying a gift card remains a better  and more thoughtful  Christmas present than stuffing a banknote or two into a card \\nGift cards in the US have a five year minimum expiry\\nGift cards are popular  The sector  which began with the first book token issued in 1932  has grown into a £7bn a year industry in the UK  Nowadays  they can be spent and topped up online as well as redeemed in stores \\nTheir attraction to buyers is obvious  Buying a card for a certain brand displays a personal touch  It avoids the awkward Christmas Day moment of a loved one pretending to love the jumper they intend to return and swap with something more of their style \\nBut cards come with associated risks  Most expire after two years  Gift cards in the US tend to have a five year expiry date  prompting campaigns to introduce the same conditions over here \\nUse them or lose them\\nWhile research suggests half are spent within a month  and 98 6% within a year  we still throw away tens of millions of pounds worth of out of date cards \\nThat is free money for the retailers  but the real attraction for them is that shoppers with gift cards tend to top them up with cash \\nThe UK Gift Card and Voucher Association says that two thirds of people it surveyed said they spent more than the card value when they used it to buy something  An average value of gift card spending is £27 64  but typically an extra £18 55 is spent on top \\nGift cards at Topshop can only be used to pay for up to half the value of a purchase\\nThe highly sought after younger age groups also tend to return to the brands they shopped at with gift cards \\nSome 31% of millennial or younger Generation Z shoppers have become a regular customer of a new brand or organisation after being given a gift card  the association says \\nThe association says that criticism of the sector is somewhat narrow minded \\nIts director general  Gail Cohen  says that support for vulnerable people during the coronavirus pandemic has been based around cards and vouchers \\nVolunteers have used cards rather than cash as a secure way of fetching shopping for those shielding or self isolating  while millions of pounds of free school meal vouchers were redeemed into supermarket gift cards when schools were closed \\nVouchers have also been used instead of refunds for those happy to delay experiences  rather than cancel them  during lockdown \\nYet the pandemic has had a disastrous impact on the High Street  and shoppers with gift cards are understandably nervous as they see big brands at serious risk of closing their doors \\nThe closure of Toys R Us was accompanied with disappointment for cardholders\\nThey have been stung before   but clearly never as hard as staff who have lost their jobs  Customers of House of Fraser were left in limbo for several months in 2018 after it went into administration and was bought by Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct \\nThe collapse of High Street stores such as Toys R Us  Maplin and HMV in some cases left shoppers struggling to get refunds or having to accept that their gift cards were worthless \\nThe danger is that when a retailer shuts entirely  cardholders are near the back of a long list of creditors owed money  That means they would only receive a tiny fraction  or more likely nothing  from the sale of the collapsed business\\'s assets \\nThere have been calls for cardholders to be moved up the list  but the priority scale has not been changed \\nThat is why advice to shoppers is relatively consistent   if you receive a gift card then do not hang around to spend it \\nAlex Neill  chief executive of complaints service Resolver  says  \"In the last year  some of the UK\\'s biggest brands have vanished from the High Street and online for good  Shoppers with gift cards or vouchers should not delay if a firm is close to bankruptcy   spend them now or risk losing them for good \"\\nCredit card backup\\nMs Cohen  from the trade association  says if administrators accept gift cards it can make the business a more attractive proposition for potential investors \\n\"Administrators do know that gift cards encourage shoppers into stores and keeps the tills ringing \" she says \\nSome gift cards can be used in a selection of stores and may be a safer bet\\nGift cards are there to be spent  not saved  she says  They do not gain interest  like savings  and givers would expect them to be used \\nShe points out that anyone worried about the health of specific retail businesses can buy gift cards that can be used in multiple stores \\nIf you are buying a gift card or voucher  one other tip from consumer experts is to do this using a credit card  This is because section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act can make credit card providers jointly liable for breaches of contract with a trader when you buy with a credit card \\nBut to qualify for a claim  your gift card has to be worth more than £100 and bought using a credit card \\nBanks may also give refunds through the chargeback scheme for cards bought on a debit card  although that is at their discretion \\nEither way  if you received it as a present  you will have to contact the giver to get them to chase the cash \\nCoronavirus disease named Covid 19\\nCoronavirus quarantine  \\'I

\\nBut the number of new infections nationally was down almost 20% from the day before  from 3 062 to 2 478 \\nIn recent days  Chinese authorities have increasingly been criticised for their handling of the crisis when the cases first emerged \\nThe death of a doctor whose early warnings were suppressed by authorities sparked widespread public anger \\nBeijing has now \"removed\" several senior officials over their actions to control the disease \\nThe party secretary for the Hubei Health Commission  and the head of the commission  were among those who lost their jobs  They are the most senior officials to be demoted so far \\nThe central government has also sent a team from its highest anti corruption agency to Hubei to investigate the treatment of Dr Li by police \\nmedia

be placed on indoor and outdoor meetings \\nRobin Swann said there was a need to \"challenge that complacency\" which has led to a ten fold increase in the number of weekly cases since July \\nMore cases were to be expected  he added  following an outbreak among staff at a meat plant in Cullybackey \\nThe warning came as official figures showed there were four coronavirus linked deaths registered in Northern Ireland last week \\nNo local lockdown\\nOn Thursday  it was announced that Cranswick would temporarily close for a deep clean after 35 of its 500 employees tested positive for

ordered for all staff \\n\"What we\\'re seeing is a number of positive cases coming from that source and number of small outbreaks  I don\\'t think it\\'s anything to do particularly with the

afternoon\\nThere was no indication yet that a local lockdown for the borough is necessary  he added \\n\"As long as we can connect a positive case to an outbreak and a source that we know  it\\'s not

UK\\nA raft of new lockdown restrictions are coming into force across Northern Ireland at 00 01 GMT on Friday  in a bid to stem the spread of Covid 19 \\nThere are now updated laws on what can stay open  as well as more guidance about what people can do for the next two weeks \\nHere are answers some of the many readers\\' questions we have received about the most recent changes \\nWhat do the laws say \\nThey primarily deal with setting out which businesses must stay closed for the duration of the next two weeks   until 00 01 on Friday 11 December \\nThat includes non essential retail  with shops only allowed to offer click and collect services \\nPubs  restaurants and cafes are also closed and can only offer takeaway and delivery services  with a closing time of 23 00 \\nTakeaway shops also have to shut by 23 00  and off licences and supermarkets can only sell alcohol until 20 00 \\nClose contact services   hairdressers and beauty salons   are also closed again  The executive says mobile hairdressers and make up artists are included in this too \\nThe executive says there are exemptions for businesses relating to \"the continuation of essential health interventions and therapeutics\" but other services like tanning  electrolysis  spa services and tattoo parlours must close again too \\nDress fitting and tailoring shops also fall under the category of shops that must close  unless they can maintain social distancing \\nHow are schools and travelling to work affected \\nSchools are not closing this time  and childcare services are open as normal too \\nSchools do not have to close this time\\nUniversities and further education colleges are being told to deliver distance learning \"to the maximum extent possible\"   with only essential face to face learning where it is necessary and unavoidable \\nThe executive has also reinforced its advice that people should work from home \"unless unable to do so\" \\nCan people come into my house \\nFor the most part  this is not allowed \\nIndoor household visits were banned in all parts of Northern Ireland on 22 September \\nNo more than six people from two households can meet in private gardens  but children under 12 do not count towards the total \\nThere are limited exemptions for indoor visits such as \\nSo called bubbling with one other household   but it is limited to a maximum of 10 people from the two households\\nCaring responsibilities including childcare\\nEssential maintenance\\nSupported living arrangements\\nVisits required for legal or medical purposes\\nA marriage or civil partnership ceremony in a private dwelling where one partner is terminally ill\\nNo overnight stays in a private home will be allowed  unless you are part of a bubble \\nThere will be changes for a five day period over Christmas  where people will be allowed to meet in up to three households indoors   but the executive has stressed that these are temporary and limited plans for the festive season only \\nCan I still stay in a hotel \\nHotels mostly had to close during the last period of restrictions imposed on 16 October  and since then they\\'ve only been allowed to operate in limited circumstances \\nThere are exemptions for them to offer rooms to essential workers such as workers who need hotels for work related purposes and \"staff on the front line battling Covid\" \\nIt also applies to people who are unable to return to their main address  those in emergency situations and vulnerable people \\nCampsites and caravan parks for touring caravans are also closed \\nCan I go to a holiday home or in self catering accommodation \\nIt would appear not \\nThe executive says self catering accommodation will only be permitted to operate on a \"restricted basis\" during the lockdown \\nThat is in line with arrangements for other accommodation providers  including hotels  it adds \\nCan I travel outside Northern Ireland \\nThere is nothing in the regulations banning travel  but advice from Stormont is that \"no unnecessary travel should be undertaken\" \\nThe executive said it was issuing \"strong guidance\" that people should stay at home and limit their contacts as much as possible \\nBut it has not detailed what constitutes necessary or unnecessary travel \\nThe executive says people should be mindful of the risks of spreading the virus by travel  and should use their judgement when deciding whether or not to undertake a journey \\nThe Department of Health also regularly updates its list of countries that require travellers to self isolate on arriving back in Northern Ireland   failure to do so could land you with a £1 000 fine \\nIt\\'s also worth bearing in mind that the Republic of Ireland and other parts of Great Britain have their own guidelines on when travel is permitted at present \\nAre weddings and funerals affected \\nYes  Although marriages  civil partnerships and funerals can continue to be held  there are big changes about how they can take place \\nNo more than 25 people are allowed to attend the services  and no wedding receptions are allowed \\nNo pre or post funeral gatherings are permitted either  and wakes cannot take place \\nCan I still go to church \\nYes \\nThe executive says places of worship can continue to open for the purposes of individual prayer only \\nThere is also a mandatory requirement to wear face coverings when entering and exiting places of worship  It does not apply to parties to a marriage or civil partnerships \\nIs it OK to travel for shopping \\nAll but essential retail is closing

that are prevented from operating in homes by the new measures \\nWhat about visits to hospitals or care homes \\nEarlier this year  care homes and hospitals were advised to significantly scale back visits \\nOne member of a family is allowed to visit once a week while the lockdown measures apply \\nThe executive said more frequent visits may be permitted in exceptional circumstances  including for people in palliative care facilities and those receiving end of life care \\nDo I have to shield again \\nNo \\nThe executive says it is not yet reintroducing guidance to shield  after it was paused in July \\nIt does however  say that medically vulnerable and older people living in Northern Ireland should be \"particularly careful\" in following the advice to limit household contacts and maintaining all other public health measures \\nWhere do I have to wear a face covering now \\nThey have been mandatory on public transport since July  and in shops since August  with a limited number

the new measures  but during Wednesday\\'s Prime Minister\\'s Questions he accused Boris Johnson of \"losing control\" of the virus and of virus testing \\nMr Johnson defended the NHS Test and Trace system  saying it was allowing the government to to see \"in granular detail\" where the epidemic was breaking out \\nEarlier  Mr Raab said there would always be the \"Goldilocks criticism   too much or too little\" of the government\\'s strategy  but that the aim was to avoid the need for more drastic action \\nHe said if people followed all the existing measures  the country would \"get through this\" and \"get to Christmas not in a national lockdown\" \\nHe said there was no fixed end time to the measures   which the prime minister has warned could last up to six months \\nmedia caption\\nBoris Johnson said that collective health depends on \"individual behaviour\"\\nIn an interview on Radio 4\\'s Today programme  Prof Edmunds said the comprehensive lockdown in March had brought the R number   which measures how quickly the virus is spreading   down from 2 7 to 0 7 \\nA large range of measures was now needed to stop the epidemic growing any further  he said  casting doubt on the changes of R being below one by Christmas  \"I suspect not  There\\'s a chance  of course there\\'s a chance \" he said \\n\"To slow the epidemic down will mean putting the brakes on very hard  I suspect we will see very stringent measures coming in through the UK but it will be too late \" he warned \\n\\'Too late\\'\\nProf Peter Openshaw  who is also a member of the government\\'s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies  Sage   said a ban on households mixing indoors in England \"ought to be instituted sooner rather than later\" \\nSpeaking to Radio 5 Live\\'s Emma Barnett  he said  \"I think [a ban] may well be coming very soon  I would think if we wait two or three weeks  it will be too late \"\\nThe government\\'s chief medical adviser  Prof Chris Whitty  is reported to believe it is inevitable England will to have to follow Scotland\\'s latest move  according to the Times \\nAnother scientist  Prof Carl Heneghan  from Oxford University  said the measures seemed to show the emphasis of public policy was moving towards personal responsibility  similar to the approach taken in Sweden \\nHe told Today  \"We\\'re starting to understand that we\\'re trying to control the spread of infection as opposed to suppress it \"\\nHe added it was important to give these new measures time to work  maintain a clear and consistent public message and not to panic \\nDebate is only going to get more heated\\nThe debate about what is the right thing to do is just going to get more heated in the coming days and weeks \\nCases are rising   and most experts agree the steps taken by the government  certainly in England  are only going to having a minimum effect on curbing an increase in infection rates \\nWhat no one knows is how quickly cases will go up   and what impact that will have on hospital admissions and deaths \\nIf the government is determined to suppress the virus   to get the R below one as the prime minister said   more draconian measures will surely follow \\nBut if it was definitely going for this approach  it would surely have gone further with the restrictions it announced on Tuesday  Lockdown style measures have a greater impact when they are taken earlier \\nThat is what has prompted suggestions it may be moving towards adopting the \"Swedish model\" of accepting some spread  This is being done in the knowledge the UK is now in a better position to protect the vulnerable and treat those who get really sick   enabling ministers to balance the risk of the virus versus the risk to the economy  society and wider health and wellbeing \\nBut it means the big decision is yet to come   and crucial to that will be what happens to hospital cases and deaths \\nThe devolved nations have their own powers over coronavirus restrictions \\nScotland\\'s Deputy First Minister John Swinney acknowledged the new rules banning people from visiting other people\\'s homes were \"difficult and disruptive\" and said they would be reviewed every three weeks \\n\"No one wants to have this in place a moment longer  The more public compliance  the more successful we will be \" he told BBC Breakfast \\nAnalysis  Last throw of dice

\\nCovid  Deaths near lowest level since March\\nCoronavirus contributed to 1% of all deaths in England and Wales in the second week of this month \\nThat\\'s among the lowest figures published by the Office for National Statistics  ONS  since March when the pandemic took hold \\nIt\\'s feared this will rise following recent increases in cases and hospitalisations \\nDeaths from all causes in England and Wales were higher than average in the week to 11 September \\nThis is likely to be because the August Bank Holiday delayed reporting  however \\nThe north west of England had the most deaths from coronavirus \\nThe ONS counted registrations where \"novel coronavirus\" was mentioned on the death certificate \\nAlthough coronavirus deaths remain relatively low  this week also marks the first time they have increased rather than decreased since the beginning of April \\nThe government is poised to introduce new restrictions on gatherings and hospitality  as cases of infection have begun to rise again \\nDeaths hit their lowest point since mid March in the week to 4 September  with 78 deaths certificates mentioning coronavirus as a factor \\nBut analysis from Oxford University suggests that the number of Covid 19 deaths could be even lower \\nThe ONS count includes any death certificate that mentions Covid 19 \\nThe Oxford analysis suggests that an increasing proportion of these death registrations mention Covid 19 without saying that the disease was a direct or underlying cause of the death \\nIn total  there were 51 818 deaths in England and Wales where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate   making up 12% of all deaths this year \\nThe ONS also looked at deaths among the working age population between March and June  before many lockdown restrictions were eased \\nIt found of just over 5 000 deaths   72%   were likely to be the result of an infection acquired before lockdown came into force \\nPeople working in factories  and in the care and leisure sectors  had a significantly higher risk of dying than the average population \\nView comments\\nMilitary to support Birmingham\\'s Covid 19 testing\\nThe \\'drop and collect service\\' sees tests dropped off at a resident\\'s door and collected by staff\\nMilitary support is being brought in to help with the coronavirus testing programme in Birmingham \\nAbout 100 military personnel will aid Birmingham City Council with its \"drop and collect\" testing programme \\nAt a weekly briefing  the council\\'s deputy leader said it would assist civilian efforts to maximise the numbers of tests able to be done \\nIt comes as the number of cases in the city reached 107 6 per 100 000 people   the highest in the West Midlands \\nThe \"drop and collect service\" sees tests dropped off at a resident\\'s door and then collected by staff and is aimed at areas with high rates of infection  to provide a service to people who can\\'t leave their homes and to encourage those who may not be proactive in getting tested \\nBirmingham is one of the areas in the West Midlands which is under extra restrictions to curb increasing coronavirus cases\\n\"We have been in talks with the military about them giving us some extra capacity for drop and collect \" deputy leader  councillor Brigid Jones told a meeting of the West Midlands Combined Authority on Friday \\nShe said their assistance would be \"very much in an extra capacity  feet on the ground sense\" and 500 council staff had also been redeployed to the \"drop and collect\" testing service \\nSince the start of the pandemic  the Armed Forces have helped to increase national testing capacity \\nUnder the Military Aid to Civilian Authorities system  around 100 military personnel will work to support our Drop and Collect testing  expecting to start within next week pic twitter com/LsI0ROOupQ\\n— Bham City Council  @BhamCityCouncil  September 25  2020\\nThe BBC is not responsible for the

although testing has increased dramatically  the rate of positive cases to tests has also increased to 6 7% \\n\"Our plea to residents would be  if one of our staff knocks on your door  please take up the opportunity to take a test \" Ms Jones added \\nCoronavirus  University return \\'could spark Covid avalanche\\'\\nUniversities in the UK are being urged to scrap plans for face to face teaching until Christmas in order to prevent a second wave of coronavirus \\nAcademics\\' union UCU said more than a million students moving around the country was \"a recipe for disaster\" \\nBut university bosses say they have worked hard to plan for a safe return to all aspects of student life \\nIt comes as daily recorded cases of coronavirus in the UK reached 1 715 in 24 hours  the highest since early June \\nCase numbers began edging up again in the UK in July  after falling in June   but are still much lower than the 5 000 new cases a day there were in April  at the peak of the epidemic \\nExperts say the increase in testing over recent weeks means more people with the virus are being detected \\nStudents back at uni   but with masks and no bars\\nWhat if I still don\\'t have the place I want  And other questions\\nIs it time for us to move on from coronavirus  asks our medical editor\\nWhat\\'s the union saying \\nThe UCU\\'s Jo Grady says having tens of thousands of students heading into cities across the UK \"risks doing untold damage to people\\'s health and exacerbating the worst public health crisis of our lifetimes\" \\nShe told BBC Breakfast the mass migration of a million students could prompt a \"silent avalanche of infections\" \\n\"There is far more of a risk than perhaps the general public has appreciated \" she said  adding that universities were not prepared and risked becoming the \"care homes of the second wave\" \\nManchester will welcome around 100 000 students as the new university term begins  Dr Grady said\\nDr Grady said Manchester would see 100 000 students arriving  Birmingham 80 000  and Leicester 40 000 \\n\"These are all cities that have had some form of local lockdown and have come out of it or are about to go into one \" she said \\nAnd she warned the higher number of students expected at universities this year would make social distancing harder \\nWhat\\'s been the response \\nUniversities UK  which represents campus leaders  says many staff want to return to face to face teaching and research \"where it is safe and appropriate to do so\" \\nThey are mindful of the benefits of in person teaching and support for students\\' well being and development  its president  Prof Julia Buckingham  said \\nMore students than expected are heading to university this autumn after a U turn saw many achieve the grades they needed\\nThe government says it is \"confident that universities are well prepared for the return of students by taking measures such as introducing social distancing on campus  limiting travel requirement for classes and staggering teaching across extended days to reduce numbers on site\" \\nIt said guidance is \"under constant review\" to reflect the latest public health advice such as 2m distancing  or 1m plus with measures such as face coverings \\nProf Jonathan Ball  a virologist at the University of Nottingham  said universities were aware students returning to campus might be \"a potential flair point for coronavirus infection\" and were taking that risk \"seriously\" \\nHe said universities would have their own rules and guidance  with sanctions \"for students who willingly  knowingly break the rules of engagement\" \\nBut he cited veterinary students who had already returned to Nottingham  whom he praised for their \"incredibly good\" behaviour and attitude \\n\"We have to allow these students to get the education that they have worked hard for   and to enjoy university life as much as is possible at the moment \" he told BBC News \\nWhat are experts saying \\nProf Carl Heneghan  director of the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at the University of Oxford  says it is safe for students to return to universities \\nHe told Breakfast that \"right now it is as safe as it ever has been\" to go back to campuses \\nBut he suggested universities could put back face to face teaching until the end of the academic year in spring or summer 2021  when the threat from coronavirus might have reduced \\n\"Can we do something over the summer  can we put a summer school on \" he asked  adding  \"We need to maximise that [teaching] experience \"\\nSecond wave fears don\\'t reflect how life has changed\\nThe language used by unions is very strong  There are plenty of infectious disease and public health experts who would not paint the threat in such extreme terms \\nWhenever we hear about risks of a second wave or a sharp rise in cases we need to consider where we have come from \\nThe initial surge happened because the virus was spreading pretty much undetected for a period \\nIt was certainly more widespread than the UK and other countries realised in February and March \\nBy the time lockdown came there were an estimated 100 000 new infections a day in the UK \\nToday we have over 1 000 confirmed infections a day  on average \\nOf course some are going undetected  but it is clear the virus is currently under control \\nAs people circulate more   going back to work  schools and university   the likelihood is infections will rise \\nBut everyday life has completely transformed from what it was in February   there are many reasons why a second surge in infections like the first can  and should  be avoided \\nWhat will university look like during coronavirus \\nStudents preparing for the new university term can expect changes on campuses   much like those that have affected other aspects of life since March \\nStrict cleaning measures  lots of hand sanitiser  one way systems and capacity limits for places such as the library and coffee shop will be common \\nClose knit seminars and office hours with lecturers are unlikely to take place face to face as they did before \\nVeterinary science students at the University of Nottingham returned to their studies in July\\nAt the University of Leicester  students and staff will be screened for Covid 19 from October using a new form of mass testing developed by the institution\\'s academics \\nVice chancellor Prof Nishan Canagrarajah told the BBC Leicester would regularly test as many as 10 000 students and staff to monitor infections throughout the academic year  alongside NHS Test and Trace \\nThere will also be staggered arrival times to prevent all students returning to the city at once  he said \\nCHILDREN\\'S RISK  Study shows it is \\'tiny\\'\\nGETTING ABOUT  Is it safe to use public transport \\nBACK TO SCHOOL  Does my child have to return \\nAlmost all institutions will be making greater use of online teaching methods for students studying non practical subjects \\nAside from studies  Swansea University said plans to keep students safe included \"bubbles\" among flatmates  meaning a ban on parties or having people over to stay \\nAnd nights out will look different  too  The University of Sheffield\\'s student union has implemented an ordering app and table service  making its bars less crowded \\nIn Manchester  a

business has to close because of restrictions  that closure is permanent \" he said \\n\"Those businesses and the people who work for them need financial support to see them through this tough time until their businesses can open again \"\\nAnalysis  Liz Roberts  BBC Radio Sheffield political reporter\\nThe plan was to \"simplify and standardise\" but there was nothing but confusion after the PM\\'s announcement \\nThere are significant differences between the infection rates in Sheffield and Doncaster for example  but people in the whole of South Yorkshire  which also includes Barnsley and Rotherham  will be subject to the new rules \\nMeanwhile those just over the border in North East Derbyshire and Chesterfield will remain on the \"medium\" level  despite being in the same mayoral authority of the Sheffield City Region \\nThe Labour local authority leaders and the city region\\'s mayor have broadly welcomed the restrictions  but they are asking the government to provide a better financial package \\nWith the \"very high\" risk level approaching  it is unlikely they will agree to additional business closures without more support for the local economy \\nFor more insight

NHS really need protecting \\nEngland has exited lockdown but for nearly all the country  Wednesday marks just a small step back towards normality \\nWith the exception of Cornwall  the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly  strict restrictions mean people\\'s lives are being curtailed \\nA crucial factor   ministers have argued   is that the NHS risks being overwhelmed without the tough curbs on freedoms  But is this really true \\nThere are nearly 13 000 beds free\\nA quick glance at the latest data on hospital beds shows there were nearly 13 000 beds free at the end of November \\nThat\\'s 50% more than last winter \\nThere are also several thousand beds available in private hospitals that the NHS has paid for until the end of the year that could be used for non Covid patients \\nIt means  in theory  there are enough beds available to cope with a doubling of Covid patients   there are currently about 14 000 in hospital \\nBut that\\'s just theory…\\nIn practice  the NHS is meant to keep at least a tenth of its beds free to create flexibility to admit patients and cope with surges in demand \\nIt also allows time for cleaning and infection control   something that is  of course  particularly important during a pandemic \\nIn fact  the need for social distancing and infection control has meant hospitals have had to be reconfigured significantly  leading to 13 000 beds being lost from the system \\nWhat is more  the pressures are not felt evenly around the country \\nThe past few months have been marked by individual hospitals getting dangerously close to full  with some reporting more than a quarter of beds occupied by Covid patients \\nBut the flip side of that is that some are not  Explaining why he was voting against the new tiers  Tim Loughton  the Tory MP for East Worthing and Shoreham  said his hospital had just four Covid patients \\nThese differences matter  Hospital capacity is one of the five key tests for working out which tier local areas are in \\nHospitals are trying to keep core stuff going\\nWhile doing this  the NHS is playing a juggling act  In the spring  a lot of planned work  including some cancer care  was cancelled \\nThe decision was taken because of the fear that hospitals could be completely overwhelmed  But it meant significant numbers of beds were left unused as the data for June in the chart below shows \\nBut this chart also demonstrates how the NHS has tried to get services back to normal over the summer and autumn with the number of non Covid patients in hospital  shown in green  climbing \\nThis is deemed essential because of the growing backlog in numbers waiting for treatment  Macmillan estimates there are more than 40 000 missing cancer patients \\nMeanwhile  the numbers waiting over a year for routine treatment  such as knee and hip operations  is at its highest level since 2008 \\nIt is easy to think these sort of treatments can wait  But as Royal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen says  these are patients whose lives are on hold left waiting \"potentially in pain\" \\nThe desire to keep the non Covid work going is strong   and when you put this all together  it leaves very little wriggle room \\nIt means any significant increase in Covid patients above the level seen now has a direct impact on non Covid care \\nAll this is being done while staff are exhausted with significant numbers   30 000 at last count   off work for Covid related issues \\nBut what about the Nightingales \\nEngland has a network of seven field hospitals known as Nightingales  These were built during the spring  again on the assumption that hospitals could become overwhelmed \\nOne of the challenges the NHS has faced is that it has fewer doctors  nurses and beds per head of population than many other western European countries \\nTory MP John Redwood has been vocal in calling for the Nightingales to be used  accusing those making dire warnings of trying to \"scare\" the public  Between them they could provide care to several thousand patients \\nBut the problem is they need staff  Chris Hopson  of NHS Providers  which represents hospital managers  says they were only ever built as an \"insurance policy\" to be used as a last resort if hospitals were overwhelmed \\nTo open them would mean spreading staff more thinly across hospitals and the Nightingales  That  of course  has consequences for the quality of care  It is the reason why only two have been pressed into action during the second wave \\nStretching the NHS beyond the point it is at currently is certainly possible  but it will have consequences \\nCoronavirus  How to get a Covid test\\nLiverpool is the first English city to have regular coronavirus testing for all residents  whether they have symptoms or not  as part of a pilot \\nTesting is considered a key way to control the epidemic  but government\\'s system has experienced setbacks \\nShould I get tested \\nTesting people and then tracing the contacts of those infected is vital to stop the disease from spreading \\nYou should seek a test if you show one of these three key symptoms \\na fever\\na new continuous cough\\na loss of smell or taste\\nThe idea of testing is to find people with the virus and keep them isolated to avoid it being spread through the wider community \\nUntil you can get a test it\\'s important you and your household self isolate \\nWhat are coronavirus symptoms \\nRemember the R number  Why is it so important \\nHow to get tested\\nGo online  or call 119  before going to a drive through or walk through testing site   or a mobile testing unit\\nOrder a home testing kit in the first four days of having symptoms\\nGovernment apologises over Covid tests shortage\\nIs the testing system coping with demand \\nThe testing system experienced plenty of well publicised problems early on  with people struggling to book \\nThere were also multiple cases where some people could only book tests many miles from their homes \\nBut the system is running much better now and coping with demand \\nHow many tests are being carried out \\nRoughly 300 000 tests a day on average were processed in the week to 1 November  The government says capacity is more than 500 000  although that number of tests has never actually been carried out in a day \\nIt has pledged to bring in mass coronavirus testing by the end of the year  even among people with no symptoms \\nThe prime minister has spoken of his desire for 10 million Covid 19 tests a day by early 2021  but experts have expressed doubt that this is possible \\nHowever  Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the two new testing mega labs   which open in early 2021   will add 600 000 tests to the UK\\'s daily capacity \\nWhat kind of tests are available \\nThe first kind tests to see if you are currently infected \\nIn most cases a nose and throat swab is taken and then sent to be processed at a lab \\nThere are also rapid turnaround versions of these tests which are mostly available in hospitals \\nOne of the types available uses a technology similar to that of the slower lab tests  but scaled down so it can be processed using a portable machine \\nAnother  so called \"lateral flow\" tests   which are being used in the Liverpool pilot   involve a handheld kit that gives a result a bit like a pregnancy test \\nBecause these miss out the step of amplifying the virus\\'s genetic information  they are less sensitive and will therefore will miss more cases of the virus   especially in people with relatively mild infections \\nThese lateral flow kits are extremely valuable in areas without big labs  which currently have very little access to any testing at all  But up until recently they haven\\'t been seen as a key part of the UK\\'s testing strategy \\nTests on saliva are also being trialled \\nThe second kind of test involves blood samples and looks for antibodies which indicate past  rather than current  infection \\nAt the moment  these are mainly being used by scientists to estimate what percentage of the population has had Covid  rather than to diagnose individuals \\nmedia caption\\nBBC Reality Check looks at why testing for coronavirus matters\\nWhat about private testing \\nPrivate tests can be obtained from clinics and health centres  with some offering a result within three days \\nPrices vary but are often around £100 £200 for a swab test   which shows if you are currently infected   and £50 £100 for an antibody test  which can indicate a past infection  However antibody tests do not work for everyone   and even some people who have had coronavirus do not have antibodies \\nTests must have a \\'\\'CE mark\\'\\' to show they meet all legal criteria \\nIf you test positive  the test supplier must let your local health authority know so it can trace outbreaks \\nHow reliable are tests \\nWith the most common type of diagnostic test  scientists at the University of Bristol believe 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative   wrongly telling someone they are not infected \\nThis can be because the swab sample wasn\\'t good enough  there were problems in the lab  or because of the stage of infection the patient was at when tested \\nHow does the UK compare with other countries \\nEach country records testing slightly differently  so like for like comparisons won\\'t be 100% accurate \\nHowever  analysis from Our World In Data  a research team at the University of Oxford  suggests the UK is now performing more tests than many other countries \\nFor example  on 1 November  the UK carried out 417 tests per 100 000 people  This compares favourably to similar European countries  in France the number was 433 per 100 000 while in Germany it was 232 and in Spain 247 per 100 000 people \\nThis just tells us the raw numbers  though  and not how many tests were being carried out in proportion to the size of a country\\'s outbreak  or how well the tests were targeted

lockdown at 18 00 BST on Sunday  24 hours after the Carmarthenshire town of Llanelli \\nIt means 1 5 million people  about half of Wales\\' population  will be under lockdown by the end of the weekend \\nBut cases in Caerphilly  the first area to lockdown  have fallen significantly  Health Minister Vaughan Gething said \\nThe restrictions will be the same as those already affecting people living in Merthyr Tydfil  Bridgend  Blaenau Gwent  Newport  Rhondda Cynon Taf and Caerphilly  which are already in lockdown \\nMr Gething said people in Cardiff and Swansea should not \"treat this weekend as a big blow out\" \\nHe also said cases in Carmarthenshire had \"overwhelmingly\" been linked to Llanelli  with eight out of 10 cases there \\n\"In Llanelli we have a particular challenge around the town that is well identified  a significant spread that is not in control \" he said at a Welsh Government press conference \\n\"We\\'ve spoken to the local authority  we\\'ve spoken to the local health

new rules live \\nRob Stewart  leader of Swansea council  said  \"We have seen a rapid and sharp increase in the number of covid cases in Swansea during the past few weeks \\n\"So  like much of the population of Wales  we are now in a lockdown  This will mean changes to people\\'s everyday lives but they will help to protect people and our communities \"\\nHe described a \"balanced judgement\" being taken that the rules should come into force in Cardiff and Swansea a day later to \"allow people to plan\" \\nThere will be nine areas of Wales under restrictions\\nIn the past seven days  85 of 109 cases in Carmarthenshire have been in Llanelli where the rate of infection is 151 6 per 100 000 people  compared to 57 7 in the wider county \\nThe Llanelli lockdown is the first not to cover a whole local authority area  A postcode finder will be made available online to make clear which areas are under lockdown  said Mr Gething \\nThe majority of cases in Llanelli have been linked to people socialising without social distancing \\nBurry Port  which is also in Carmarthenshire  will not be included in the area under restrictions \\nSwansea has recorded 63 6 cases per 100 000 people over the past seven days  while Cardiff has recorded 46 1 \\nThe seven day case rate for the whole of Wales is just shy of 57 per 100 000 \\nCardiff  Swansea and Llanelli are the latest areas to be locked down\\nMeanwhile  cases of coronavirus have been traced to three pubs in Porthcawl  Bridgend county  with customers encouraged to look out for symptoms \\nPHW said a number of people had tested positive for the virus after visiting The Royal Oak in South Road  The Marine on the Esplanade and The Pier on the Esplanade on the evening of 11 September \\nGemma Northey  chairwoman of the multi agency incident management team for PHW  said anyone who has visited the pubs and been identified as a contact would be contacted by the Test  Trace  Protect team and given further advice \\nShe said those who had visited the pubs and developed symptoms must self isolate  along with any household members  and book a coronavirus test promptly  but those who were not symptomatic did not need to take action \\nHow do businesses feel \\nThe new restrictions mean people in lockdown can only shop in their own counties  or in the case of Llanelli  their own town \\nMike Richards  who owns an antique shop in Llanelli  is angry the town has been singled out \\n\"It\\'s totally unacceptable \" he said  \"We\\'re part of Carmarthenshire   the council are supposed to look after us and Carmarthen  \\n\"We\\'d be goldfish bowls   local customers only   60% of my trade is from outside Llanelli  I\\'ll have to live with that but I\\'m not living with Carmarthen having their own way  \\n\"With

Moruzzi  from Verdi\\'s cafe in Mumbles  Swansea  said the lack of tourism would hit the business hard \\nHe said  \"We don\\'t just get people coming from other areas of Wales  but also England \\n\"We had people from Somerset call earlier who\\'d arranged to come next week but they can\\'t come anymore \\n\"I think it will affect a lot of the trade  We prepared for the first lockdown but not so much for the local one \"\\nWhat about university students \\nAs students return  Mr Gething said the effect on university towns will be monitored \\nHe said  \"One of the things we\\'ll need to do is to understand how the pattern is changing within those university towns and cities once students have been there for a period of time \\n\"At this point in time with a large movement of people across the UK  we need to understand what that does in terms of local prevalence so I don\\'t think now is the time to make a definitive choice about what would happen in the end of your recess but it\\'s an obvious question for us to consider \"\\nWhat can I do \\nUnder the rules  nobody is able to enter or leave the eight counties and one town without a \"reasonable excuse\" \\nPeople are allowed to travel to outside the area for a limited number of reasons \\nThese include going to work if they are not able to work from home  to go to school  give care and buy food or medical supplies \\nDr Keith Reid  executive director of public health at Swansea Bay health board  said  \"How long Swansea stays in local lockdown is entirely up to the people of Swansea  You have it in your gift to end this lockdown as early as possible and save lives \"\\nWhat about areas not locked down \\nAside from the areas being locked down  Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales  said Vale of Glamorgan  Carmarthen  Anglesey  Conwy  Denbighshire and Flintshire were all \"areas of concern to us and we are watching the data from there carefully\" \\nMinisters and officials said they would look at data over the weekend before deciding whether restrictions needed to be extended to Neath Port Talbot  Vale of Glamorgan and Torfaen  Mr Gething said \\nMeetings will also take place next week with council leaders in north Wales  where Mr Gething said the picture was \"more mixed\" \\nLeader of Neath Port Talbot council  Rob Jones  said it was \"inevitable\" the county would follow neighbouring Swansea into local lockdown if cases continued to rise \\nCarmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said  \"It is worrying to see how sharply the number of positive cases has risen in the Llanelli area  and action has had to be taken to help stop the spread and break the chain of infections concentrated in this area to prevent a whole county lockdown \\n\"We must all do the right thing  follow the advice

elect Joe Biden says Americans won\\'t be forced to take a coronavirus vaccine when one becomes available in the US \\nIt comes as the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  for the first time urged \"universal mask use\" indoors  unless when Americans are at their own home \\nThe CDC said the US had \"entered a phase of high level transmission\" of the virus \\nOn Friday the US recorded over 2 500 deaths and nearly 225 000 new cases \\nIt has confirmed 14 3 million cases and more than 278 000 deaths \\n\\'Coronavirus ended our marriage\\'\\nDr Fauci apologises for saying UK \\'rushed\\'

\\n\"My guess is there\\'ll still be a platform ceremony but I don\\'t know how it\\'s all going to work out \" he said \\nWhat is Biden\\'s policy on vaccines \\nPfizer  which says its vaccine has been shown to be 95% effective in clinical trials  and Moderna  which says its jab is 94% effective  have both applied to the Food and Drug Administration to distribute their drugs in the US \\nThe UK on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer vaccine \\nEarlier on Friday Vice President Mike Pence said during a visit to Atlanta\\'s CDC that federal approval for a Covid 19 vaccine could be \"a week and a half away \"\\nmedia caption\\nHow will the new Pfizer vaccine work \\nSpeaking in Wilmington  Delaware  the US president elect said it would not be necessary to make a coronavirus vaccine mandatory \\n\"I will do everything in my power as president to encourage people to do the right thing and when they do it  demonstrate that it matters \" he said \\nThe Pew Research Center says just 60% of Americans are currently prepared to take a coronavirus vaccine  up from 51% who said the same in September \\nOn Thursday Mr Biden told CNN he would be happy to take a vaccine in public to allay potential concerns about its safety  Three former presidents   Barack Obama  George W Bush and Bill Clinton   have said they are also prepared to be inoculated publicly \\nMr Biden has also reiterated his call for Americans to wear a mask for 100 days   a measure that he said combined with vaccine distribution would see deaths \"drop off the edge\" \\n\"My hope is they will then be inclined to say it\\'s worth the patriotic duty to go ahead and protect other people \" Mr Biden said \\nFear of political wrangling\\nThe US fight to control the coronavirus pandemic is about to slam head first into a national anti vaccine movement that is stubbornly pervasive \\nThat reality may be behind President elect Biden\\'s statement that he would not support a government mandate that all Americans receive a Covid 19 vaccination  The attempt to implement one   even if supported by science and legal precedent dating back more than a century   could create a groundswell of opposition that would prove counterproductive to public health \\nSuch was the case with mask wearing   a less intrusive step to prevent the spread of the virus   which  over the past six months  has become infused with politics \\nMr Biden  and state governors who would be on the front lines of any such mandate  might prefer to target only certain segments of the population more at risk of contracting or spreading Covid 19  For instance  employers could be encouraged to require healthcare and nursing home workers to be immunised  and most children already must have up to date shot records before attending public or private schools \\nWhile the speedy development of multiple vaccines has offered reason for hope of more normal life after the coronavirus pandemic  a brewing vaccination fight is just one example of how managing this public health crisis in the coming months will not be an easy task for the Biden administration \\nWhat is the CDC advising Americans to do \\nThe health body said it was now recommending that people wear masks anywhere outside their own homes   including indoors \\nIt said the country was in a phase of \"high level transmission\" as colder weather was seeing more people spend more time indoors \\nAbout half of new cases were the result of transmission from infected people who did not have any symptoms  the CDC said \\nIt said mask wearing  physical distancing and avoiding non essential indoor spaces and crowded outdoor spaces were part of a \"multi pronged\" approach needed to \"provide a bridge\" to a future where vaccines were widely available and normal life could resume \\nMuch of California has been hit with a stay at home order\\nOn Thursday Mr Biden said he would make mask wearing in federal buildings mandatory \\nMeanwhile  California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has issued a stay at home order for much of his state  On Wednesday  Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued an order restricting all public travel on foot or vehicle  adding  \"It\\'s time to cancel everything \"\\nWhat about US jobs \\nMr Biden described the latest jobs data as \"grim\" \\nFigures from November  released earlier on Friday  showed that a lower than expected 245 000 new jobs were added as the rate of new daily infections almost doubled \\n\"It shows an economy that\\'s stalling and remains in the midst of one of the worst economic and job crisis in modern history \" Mr Biden said \\nJob growth slows in US as virus cases surge\\nHe predicted \"the future will be very bleak\" if lawmakers fail to pass a coronavirus rescue aid package immediately \\nUnless Congress enacts another relief bill  more than nine million jobless Americans will be cut off from unemployment benefits after Christmas
